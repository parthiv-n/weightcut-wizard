export const RESEARCH_SUMMARY = `EVIDENCE BASE — Combat Sports Weight Management & Rehydration

GLYCOGEN & WATER MANIPULATION (ISSN 2025 Position Stand — Ricci et al.)
- Glycogen stores: 350-700g muscle + 80-100g liver
- Glycogen:water ratio = 1:2.7 (Bergström & Hultman 1972)
- Low-carb (<50g/d) for 3-7d = ~2% BM loss (maintains strength/power)
- Low-fibre (<10g/d): 4d = 0.4-0.7% BM; 7d = up to 1% BM
- Sodium restriction (<2300mg/d) = 0.5-1% BM over 3-5d
- Water loading: 100ml/kg/d × 3d then 15ml/kg/d = 3.2% BM loss
- Max carb delivery: ≤60g/h (ISSN point 13)
- Caffeine: 3-6 mg/kg, 60 min pre-competition

SAFE ACUTE WEIGHT LOSS (AWL) THRESHOLDS (ISSN 2025)
- ≥72h before weigh-in: up to 6.7% BM
- 48h: up to 5.7% BM
- 24h: up to 4.4% BM
- Dry sauna: 0.5-0.9% BM per session (4×10min at 90°C)
- Hot bath + wrap: up to 4.5% BM (aggressive)

DEHYDRATION & RECOVERY (Reale et al. 2017)
- 2.8% BM dehydration: reversible after 3h aggressive recovery
- 6% BM dehydration: NOT fully reversed even after 15h
- Gut transit time: 10-96h (individual variation)
- Dehydration zones: GREEN ≤2% (minimal impact), ORANGE 2-4% (needs ≥12h recovery), RED >4% (significant decrement)

REHYDRATION PROTOCOL (Reale 2018 — Gatorade SSE #183)
- Replace 125-150% of fluid lost (Shirreffs & Maughan 1998)
- ORS sodium: 50-90 mmol/L (~1150-2070 mg/L) for >3% dehydration
- Gastric emptying max: ~1000ml/h
- Carbs post weigh-in: 8-12 g/kg for significant glycogen depletion, 6-8 g/kg moderate, 4-5 g/kg minimal
- SGLT1 co-transport: glucose+sodium enhances intestinal absorption
- Carb mouth rinse: beneficial for GI-sensitive athletes (Burke & Maughan 2015)

NUTRITION FOR COMBAT ATHLETES (Nutrients reviews)
- Protein during cutting: 2.0-2.5 g/kg to preserve lean mass
- Safe deficit: 500-750 kcal/d (~0.5-0.75 kg/week)
- Aggressive deficit: 750-1000 kcal/d (~0.75-1 kg/week), never exceed 1000 kcal/d
- Minimum calories: males 1500 kcal, females 1200 kcal
- RED-S risk: energy availability <30 kcal/kg FFM
- Weekly loss: GREEN ≤0.5-1.0 kg/wk, YELLOW 1.0-1.5, RED >1.5
- Carbs: scale with training intensity, prioritize fuelling key sessions
- Fats: 20-30% of total calories

RECOMMENDED RECOVERY FOODS (from research protocols)
White rice, white bread, bananas, honey, rice cakes, sports drinks (Gatorade/Powerade), ORS, sweetened milk, chicken breast, sports gels, sports chews, candy, diluted fruit juice with salt.

PHASE LABELS: Rapid Rehydration, Active Rehydration, Glycogen Loading, Sustained Recovery, Pre-Competition, Maintenance.`;
