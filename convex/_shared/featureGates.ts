/**
 * Server-side feature gate registry.
 *
 * Single source of truth for what's gated and at which tier. Replaces the
 * old `enforceGemGate` (which deducted 1 gem per AI call) with a
 * tier-comparison: gated features need the user's effective tier to meet
 * the feature's `minTier` requirement.
 *
 * Adding a new gated feature: add a key here, then call
 * `enforceFeatureGate(ctx, userId, "MY_KEY")` from the action handler.
 *
 * Freeing a feature: change its `minTier` to `"free"` — no call-site
 * changes needed.
 *
 * Keep keys in lockstep with `src/lib/featureGates.ts` (the client
 * counterpart) so the upfront gating UX and the server enforcement agree.
