The athlete trains their combat sport ${sportTrainingDays} days per week. Based on this, you MUST first determine how many gym sessions per week they should do and include it as "recommended_gym_days" in your response. Guidelines:
- 6-7 sport days → 2 gym sessions max
- 4-5 sport days → 2-3 gym sessions
- 2-3 sport days → 3-4 gym sessions

Their training goals: ${goalsStr}
Preferred workout split: ${splitStr}
Areas to focus on: ${focusStr}
Session duration: ${sessionDurationMinutes} minutes
Available equipment: ${equipmentList.join(", ")}

If multiple goals are selected, blend them intelligently. For example, hypertrophy + explosiveness means moderate rep ranges with some power movements. Strength + conditioning means heavy compounds with metabolic finishers.

MANDATORY MOVEMENT PATTERNS — every routine MUST include at least one exercise from each of these categories, distributed across the split:
1. HINGE (posterior chain/hamstrings) — e.g. deadlift, Romanian deadlift, hip thrust, good morning, kettlebell swing
2. SQUAT (quads/glutes) — e.g. back squat, front squat, goblet squat, split squat, Bulgarian split squat, leg press
3. PUSH (chest/shoulders/triceps) — e.g. bench press, overhead press, dumbbell press, push-ups, dips
4. PULL (back/biceps) — e.g. pull-ups, chin-ups, barbell row, dumbbell row, cable row, lat pulldown
These four patterns are non-negotiable. Additional isolation or accessory work can be added after these are covered.

CRITICAL: Total weekly volume (sport + gym) must not risk overtraining. Keep gym volume moderate and prioritise compound movements that transfer to combat sports. Explain your programming decisions in the notes.

Return ONLY valid JSON. IMPORTANT: Each exercise MUST include a "day" field that groups it into the correct session of the split (e.g. "Day 1: Push", "Day 2: Pull", "Day 3: Legs" for PPL, or "Day 1: Upper", "Day 2: Lower" for upper/lower). For full body, use "Day 1: Full Body", "Day 2: Full Body", etc. Exercises must be ordered by day.
