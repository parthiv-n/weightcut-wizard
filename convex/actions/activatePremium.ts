/**
 * Activate-premium — strict, server-verified premium activation.
 *
 * The ONLY path that flips a user's `profile.subscriptionTier` from "free"
 * to a paid tier (other than the RevenueCat webhook, which is server-to-
 * server and equally trusted). The flow:
 *
 *   1. Read the caller's `userId` from Convex auth. This is also the RC
 *      `app_user_id` we configured at sign-in.
 *   2. Call `verifyEntitlement(userId)` which hits the RC REST API with a
 *      server-held `REVENUECAT_API_KEY`. RC validated the underlying
 *      StoreKit receipt against Apple, so a positive answer means Apple
 *      confirmed payment.
 *   3. If the user is NOT entitled → throw. The client never flips premium
 *      based on a client-supplied tier or expiry. There is no fallback,
 *      no grace period, no client trust.
 *   4. If verified → call the internal `profiles.activatePremiumVerified`
 *      mutation with the RC-derived tier and expiry. The mutation has
 *      lifetime / out-of-order guards but no client-trust path of its own.
 *
 * This action takes NO arguments. The previous design accepted `tier` and
 * `expiresAt` from the client — that surface was forgeable and is gone.
 *
 * Errors surface as user-facing toasts in the paywall handler:
 *   - `CONFIG_MISSING_REVENUECAT_API_KEY` — deploy misconfig, fail loud.
 *   - `RC_VERIFY_NETWORK_FAILED` / `RC_VERIFY_HTTP_*` — transient; user retries.
 *   - `RC_NOT_ENTITLED` — user genuinely hasn't paid.
