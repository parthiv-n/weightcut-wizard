/**
 * Delete-account orchestration.
 *
 * Convex has no `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so we hand-cascade across every table
 * referencing the user. We split the work across multiple internal mutations
 * because a single mutation has a write limit and would brown out for
 * power-users with thousands of meal_items. Internal mutations live in a
 * sibling V8 file (`deleteAccountMutations.ts`) since this action file is
 * Node-runtime.
 *
 * Storage cleanup is best-effort — failures there must not block account
 * deletion.
