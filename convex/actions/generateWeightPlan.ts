${SECOND_PERSON_DIRECTIVE}

USER STRUGGLE: ${primaryStruggle ?? "unspecified"}
You MUST address this struggle directly in \`personalNote\` (1-2 sentences, ≤280 chars) and weave one mitigating tactic into the relevant week's \`dailyFocus\` bullets.

Per week, return:
- \`phase\`: one of foundation | build | peak | final (the LAST week MUST be \`final\` — there is no fight_week in this flow)
- \`heroLine\`: ≤80 chars, ONE memorable sentence
- \`keyMetric\`: ≤24 chars headline (e.g. "−0.6 kg")
- \`dailyFocus\`: 3-5 bullets, each ≤60 chars, imperative voice. NO PARAGRAPHS.
- \`risk\` / \`recovery\`: ≤80 chars each, optional

Also return:
- \`phases[]\`: 2-3 macro phases with name + label + weekStart + weekEnd + 1-line \`intent\` (≤120 chars)
- \`toughestWeek\`: { week, reason ≤120 chars }
- \`personalNote\`: 10-280 chars, references the struggle above
- \`summary\`: ≤500 chars, ONE paragraph max
- \`safetyNotes\`: ≤300 chars, optional
- \`keyPrinciples\`: 3-5 short rules, each ≤120 chars
- Do NOT include \`fightWeek\` — this is the general weight-goal flow.

BANNED: paragraph-length focus strings, motivational fluff, repeating numbers already in \`calories\`/\`protein_g\`, generic advice that ignores the user struggle above, em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) anywhere in the output — use commas or periods instead.

DETERMINISTIC FACTS:
- BMR: ${bmr}, maintenance: ${maintenanceCal}, target: ${targetCal} kcal
- Macros: ${macros.protein_g}P / ${macros.carb_g}C / ${macros.fat_g}F
- Weeks: ${weekCount}, days remaining: ${days}
- Start: ${args.currentWeight}kg, goal: ${args.goalWeight}kg
