Combat sports are popular all around the world, and about one-third of their\ninjuries result in more than 7 days of absence from competition or training. The most frequently\ninjured body regions are the head and neck, followed by the upper and lower limbs, while the most\ncommon tissue types injured are superficial tissues and skin, followed by ligaments and joint capsules.\nNutrition has significant implications for injury prevention and enhancement of the recovery process\ndue to its effect on the overall physical and psychological well-being of the athlete and improving\ntissue healing. In particular, amino acid and protein intake, antioxidants, creatine, and omega-3 are\ngiven special attention due to their therapeutic roles in preventing muscle loss and anabolic resistance\nas well as promoting injury healing. The purpose of this review is to present the roles of various\nnutritional strategies in reducing the risk of injury and improving the treatment and rehabilitation\nprocess in combat sports. In this respect, nutritional considerations for muscle, joint, and bone injuries\nas well as sports-related concussions are presented. The injury risk associated with rapid weight loss\nis also discussed. Finally, preoperative nutrition and nutritional considerations for returning to a\nsport after rehabilitation are addressed.\n```\n```\nKeywords: combat sports; nutrition; recovery from injury; sports injuries; supplements\n```\n## 1. Introduction\n\n## Combat sports are characterized by repeated movements, including striking (kicking,\n\n## punching, and blocking defensive moves with the arms and legs), grappling, (wresting\n\n## an opponent to the ground or using a submission hold), and combinations of these tech-\n\n## niques [ 1 ]. Popular at competitive and recreational levels all over the world, combat\n\n## sports improve physical fitness (e.g., increased muscle strength, flexibility, and balance),\n\n## psychological aspects (e.g., self-esteem, self-awareness, and self-respect), and cognitive\n\n## function [1].\n\n## Sports participation is not without risk, and most athletes incur at least one injury\n\n## throughout their careers. Olympic combat sport athletes sustain, on average, one injury\n\n## every 2.1 h of competition [ 2 ]. Furthermore, about 30% of the injuries sustained during com-\n\n## petition result in >7 days of absence, and about 20% resulted in 1\u20137 days of absence from\n\n## competition or training [ 2 ]. The treatment and rehabilitation processes have a significant\n\n## psychological and economic burden on the athlete, family, and society. It is extremely impor-\n\n## tant to implement preventive measures such as progressive training, protective equipment\n\n## use, regulation of the competition rules, and nutrition in relation to the consequences of\n\n## injuries. Given that injuries are inevitable despite every precaution being taken, improving\n\n## the treatment and rehabilitation process and thus decreasing the recovery time remains a\n\n## fruitful area of research.\n\n```\nNutrients 2022 , 14 , 53. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010053 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\n```\n\n## Along with its effects on the physical and psychological health of the athlete, nutrition\n\n## is a pivotal factor affecting sports performance, the level of injury risk, and recovery time\n\n## from an injury. A significant body of scientific knowledge has been published on nutritional\n\n## strategies and ergogenic aids to improve sports performance [ 3 \u2013 6 ]. However, limited\n\n## research is available about the role of nutrition in reducing the risk of injury and improving\n\n## the recovery process following injuries in athletes [ 7 \u2013 11 ]. This is because, for athletes who\n\n## are intent on returning to their sport as quickly as possible, the uncertainties about injury\n\n## diagnosis and doubts regarding the efficacy of the treatment received are the main concerns\n\n## of such players. Hence, it is challenging to research such athletes. In recent years, several\n\n## review papers were published addressing the overall role of nutrition in injury prevention\n\n## and improving recovery [ 12 \u2013 15 ]. Some review papers about this issue focused on specific\n\n## injuries or conditions such as muscle injuries [ 16 \u2013 19 ], muscle damage [ 20 ], and muscle\n\n## disuse atrophy [21,22], while others focused on various sports branches such as track and\n\n## field [ 19 , 23 ], football [ 24 ], and soccer [ 19 ]. Since combat sports are popular all around\n\n## the world and about one-third of the injuries result in more than 7 days of absence from\n\n## competition or training, it is worth presenting the role of nutrition in injury prevention and\n\n## recovery. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to present various nutritional strategies\n\n## for reducing the risk of injury and improving the treatment and rehabilitation process\n\n## in combat sports. We will present the role of macro- and micronutrients, total energy\n\n## intake, and food supplements in the prevention and recovery time for injuries to skeletal\n\n## muscle, bone, tendons, and ligaments, as well as sports-related concussions (SRCs), the\n\n## most common injuries in combat sports. Furthermore, the injury risk associated with\n\n## weight cutting will be discussed along with how to reduce the potential risks. Finally,\n\n## nutritional considerations for returning to play after rehabilitation will be presented.\n\n## 2. Injuries in Combat Sports\n\n## Numerous examples of research are available on the injury prevalence in various\n\n## combat sports such as wrestling [ 25 \u2013 28 ], judo [ 29 \u2013 31 ], taekwondo [ 32 \u2013 37 ], boxing [ 38 \u2013 42 ],\n\n## and karate [ 43 \u2013 45 ], as well as comparisons of injury prevalence among Olympic combat\n\n## sports [ 2 , 46 \u2013 48 ] and martial arts [ 1 , 49 ]. Due to the heterogeneity of these studies in terms\n\n## of participants (e.g., elite vs. amateur, children or adolescents vs. adults, and male vs.\n\n## female), injury definitions, surveillance methods (e.g., self-reporting, medical records, and\n\n## injury surveillance systems), and characteristics of the reported injuries (e.g., competition\n\n## injuries vs. training injuries and acute vs. chronic injuries), it is difficult to get an overall\n\n## view of the injury rate, type, location, and severity. The majority of the published studies\n\n## present data from the adult population and injuries that occurred during competition.\n\n## Fortunately, comprehensive findings were reported in a recent prospective cohort study\n\n## by Lystad et al. [ 2 ] that documented the incidence, severity, and profile of injury and the\n\n## risk factors for injury for Olympic combat sport athletes based on the data from the IOC\n\n## injury surveillance system and exposure data from official tournament records at three\n\n## consecutive Olympic Games: Beijing 2008, London 2012, and Rio de Janeiro 2016. In the\n\n## following sections, we outline a summary of the literature about the injury rate, injury\n\n## severity, locations, and tissues most frequently injured and the risk factors for injury in\n\n## Olympic combat sports.\n\n## 2.1. Injury Rate\n\n## Olympic combat sport athletes (e.g., wrestling, judo, taekwondo, and boxing) sustain,\n\n## on average, one injury every 2.1 h of competition [ 2 ]. The injury rate per 1000 min of\n\n## exposure (IIRME) is significantly lower in wrestling (4.8) compared with taekwondo (7.7),\n\n## boxing (9.2), and judo (9.6), with an overall injury rate of 7.8 [ 2 ]. A systematic review and\n\n## meta-analysis reported that karate athletes sustain, on average, 1 injury every 25 min of\n\n## competition and most of these injuries are minor or mild in severity [ 45 ]. Other reported\n\n## IIRMEestimates in the literature for Olympic combat sports are 39.2 in karate [ 45 ], ranging\n\n## from 13.8 to 20.4 in boxing [ 40 , 50 , 51 ], 16.3 in taekwondo [ 34 ], 10.9 in judo [ 52 ], and 5.\n\n\n## in wrestling [ 53 ]. Jeong et al. [ 32 ] reported a 6.9 IIRMEfor new or recurrent injuries in\n\n## junior athletes during the 2018 World Taekwondo Junior Championships. Taekwondo was\n\n## listed within the top five most injurious sports in each of the Olympic games from 2008 to\n\n## 2016 [54\u201356].\n\n## 2.2. Injury Severity\n\n## According to the study by Lystad et al. [ 2 ], about 50% of injuries sustained during\n\n## competition result in at least 1 day of absence from training or competition. The proportion\n\n## of injuries leading to >7 days of absence from competition or training is higher in wrestling\n\n## (39.6%), judo (35.9%), and taekwondo (32.5%) than in boxing (21.0%) [ 2 ]. However, the\n\n## greatest injury burden risk was found in judo when both the incidence and severity were\n\n## taken into consideration [ 2 ]. The incidence rate for time-loss injuries in top-level karate ath-\n\n## letes was reported to be relatively low (10%) based on the data collected at four consecutive\n\n## World Karate Championships (2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016), and these injuries were due to\n\n## fractures (41%), dislocations (20%), or concussions (12%) [44].\n\n## 2.3. Injury Location\n\n## Although the distribution of injury with respect to body location has great variability\n\n## across combat sports, the most frequently injured body regions are the head and neck\n\n## (35.9%), upper limbs (31.1%), and lower limbs (26.3%) [ 2 ]. Head and neck injuries are most\n\n## common in boxing (62.1%), upper limb injuries are frequently observed in judo (42.6%), and\n\n## lower limb injuries are frequent in taekwondo (59.5%) and wrestling (45.5%) [ 2 ]. Another\n\n## study by Lystad et al. [ 45 ] reported that the head and neck were the most commonly injured\n\n## body regions in Olympic-style karate (57.9%), while contusions (68.3%) and lacerations\n\n## (18.6%) were the most frequent injury types. According to a systematic review [ 46 ] based\n\n## on nine studies of Olympic combat sports, the most frequently injured areas were the head\n\n## and face (45.8%), wrist (12.0%), and lower back (7.8%) in boxing, the fingers (22.8%) and\n\n## thigh (9.1%) in taekwondo, the knee (24.8%), shoulder (17.8%), and head or face (16.6%)\n\n## in wrestling, and the lower back (10.9%), shoulder (10.2%), and knee (9.7%) in judo. In\n\n## junior taekwondo athletes, the most frequently reported injuries were contusions, ligament\n\n## ruptures and sprains, and lacerations and fractures to the lower extremities, head, and\n\n## trunk [32].\n\n## 2.4. Injured Tissues\n\n## According to the data obtained at three consecutive Olympic Games (Beijing 2008,\n\n## London 2012, and Rio de Janeiro 2016), overall, the most commonly injured tissue types\n\n## in combat sports are superficial tissue and skin (42.9%), in addition to ligament and\n\n## joint capsule (31.4%) injuries [ 2 ]. Overall, joint sprains (31.4%) were the most frequent\n\n## injury type, followed by lacerations and abrasions (23.2%) and contusions (19.7%), while\n\n## concussions accounted for 3.2% of all recorded injuries [ 2 ]. Similarities and differences\n\n## exist in the distribution of injuries by pathology across combat sports. Contusions were\n\n## common in all combat sports (e.g., boxing: 18.5%; judo: 16.0%; taekwondo: 28.6%; and\n\n## wrestling: 21.8%). Lacerations were reported to be common in boxing (41.1%), while joint\n\n## sprains were predominant in judo (47.9%), taekwondo (33.3%), and wrestling (40.0%) [ 2 ].\n\n## Muscle injuries were most common in taekwondo (9.5%), followed by wrestling (9.1%),\n\n## boxing (5.6%), and judo (5.3%) [ 2 ]. Ligament or joint capsule injuries were most common\n\n## in judo (47.9%), followed by wrestling (40%), taekwondo (33.3%), and boxing (14.5%) [ 2 ].\n\n## Moreover, a high risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or SRCs in combat sports\n\n## athletes, particularly wrestlers, was reported. As such, the mean annual incidence of mTBI\n\n## presented to emergency departments in the United States due to wrestling was significantly\n\n## higher (269.3 per 100,000 person-years) than boxing (85.6 per 100,000 person-years) and\n\n## martial arts (61.0 per 100,000 person-years) [48].\n\n\n## 2.5. Risk Factors for Injury\n\n## Gender, weight categories, training status, nutrition, wearing protective equipment,\n\n## and competition regulations are potential factors affecting injury risk in combat sports.\n\n## Injury risk was reported to be similar between genders and among weight categories\n\n## in Olympic combat sports. However, a higher IIRMEwas observed in athletes who lost\n\n## compared with their winning opponents [ 2 ]. Similarly, when adjusted for exposure time,\n\n## no significant difference in the injury rates was observed between males and females in\n\n## Olympic-style karate [ 45 ]. However, junior male taekwondo athletes incurred more injuries\n\n## than females, and contact between the athletes was reported to be the most common cause\n\n## of injury [32].\n\n## 3. Injury Risk Associated with Rapid Weight Loss (RWL)\n\n## Combat athletes compete in specific weight categories to match competitors of similar\n\n## body weight, size, and strength [ 57 , 58 ]. Many combat athletes believe that by achiev-\n\n## ing rapid weight loss (RWL) a few days before weight categories are determined for\n\n## the competition, they gain an advantage over weaker competitors in terms of size and\n\n## strength [33,57,59]. For this purpose, they lose approximately 2\u201310% of their body weight\n\n## in the last 2\u20133 days before the competition [ 60 ]. RWL methods include severe limitation of\n\n## fluid and food intake, exercise with thermal clothing, sauna, diuretics, weight loss pills,\n\n## low-carb diets, laxatives, and vomiting [ 59 , 61 , 62 ]. All these methods may lead to several\n\n## health problems, an increased risk of injury, as well as a decrease in performance [ 60 , 61 ].\n\n## The list of health-related issues associated with RWL is long and includes both acute and\n\n## chronic effects. Interested readers may be referred to a recent review by Artioli et al. [ 60 ].\n\n## In brief, the most obvious consequences of RWL methods are dehydration and insuffi-\n\n## cient intake of nutrients, which in turn may lead to a decrease in blood plasma volume,\n\n## an increase in heart rate, impaired cardiac functions and thermoregulation, electrolyte\n\n## imbalances, low oxygen consumption, slowing of fluid passage through the kidneys, and\n\n## a decrease in glycogen stores [ 63 , 64 ]. In addition, RWL might result in hormonal imbal-\n\n## ance [ 65 , 66 ]. All of these altered physiological functions may increase the vulnerability of\n\n## the athletes to injury. Furthermore, RWL methods increase the risk of injury by negatively\n\n## affecting cognitive functions such as memory and concentration [ 29 , 58 ] and psychological\n\n## aspects [ 65 , 67 ]. For example, increased confusion, rage, fatigue, depression, and isolation,\n\n## as well as decreased short-term memory, vigour, concentration and self-esteem, have been\n\n## reported in athletes undergoing RWL practices [ 58 , 65 ]. All these psychological changes\n\n## may result in distractions, lack of control, aggressive behavior, difficulty in decision making,\n\n## and an inability to follow instructions during the match, all of which has the potential to\n\n## decrease performance and increase injury risk. Indeed, some epidemiological [ 68 ], as well\n\n## as experimental [ 69 ] data, show that RWL might increase the risk of injury. For instance,\n\n## Korean wrestlers had significantly higher injury rates during periods of RWL (23.18%) com-\n\n## pared with other training periods (11.93%) [ 70 ]. Most of the injuries occurred in the lower\n\n## extremities (38.0%), followed by upper extremity (25.9%), trunk (24.8%), and head and neck\n\n## injuries (11.3%). One study [ 70 ] reported major ligament-joint and muscle-tendon injuries\n\n## following RWL methods. In a study conducted with judokas [ 29 ], only 14% of the athletes\n\n## who did not use RWL methods were injured, while 48.7% of the judokas who applied RWL\n\n## were injured. Furthermore, a higher risk of injury was observed in athletes who lost 5 kg or\n\n## more of body weight [ 29 ]. In a case study, O\u00f6pik et al. [ 69 ] reported that a 5\u20136% reduction\n\n## in body weight within 3 days affected wrestlers\u2019 metabolisms and quadriceps femoris\n\n## muscle function, thus increasing the risk of injury. Similarly, Green et al. [ 29 ] reported a\n\n## higher probability of injury during competition in athletes who had lost more than 5% of\n\n## their body mass. Limited research is available [ 29 , 69 , 70 ] in the literature that examines the\n\n## relationship between RWL habits and the risk of injury. Thus, more research is needed on\n\n## this topic. Athletes should be advised to avoid RWL strategies to reduce the risk of injury.\n\n## Experts recommend that the use of RWL methods be banned because they meet all three of\n\n## the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)\u2019s criteria for banning a substance or method from\n\n\n## sports (potential to improve performance, potential health risk, and violation of the spirit\n\n## of sport) [60].\n\n## 4. Nutrition in Muscle Injuries\n\n## Muscle injuries are one of the most common sports injuries, leading to decreased phys-\n\n## ical activity and immobilization, depending on the severity. In the following subheadings,\n\n## we present various nutritional and ergogenic support strategies to prevent muscle loss and\n\n## promote injury healing. In this respect, due to their therapeutic roles in preventing muscle\n\n## loss and anabolic resistance as well as promoting injury-healing amino acid and protein\n\n## intake, antioxidants, creatine, and omega-3 are given special attention.\n\n## 4.1. Protein and Amino Acid Intake\n\n## Increasing protein intake during recovery is one of the first strategies in reducing\n\n## muscle loss and accelerating the healing process during the injury period [ 14 ]. In particular,\n\n## protein intake should be increased to prevent both muscle loss and anabolic resistance to\n\n## protein during immobilization after injury [ 22 ]. In this respect, the main considerations\n\n## are increasing daily protein intake in combination with exercise, balanced distribution of\n\n## protein intake during the day, and the amino acid content of protein. Increasing protein\n\n## intake to 2.3 g/kg/day is known to reduce muscle loss in states of negative energy bal-\n\n## ance [ 71 ]. For this reason, current daily protein intake recommendation (1.4 g/kg/day)\n\n## of combat athletes [ 72 ] can be increased during the injury period. On the other hand, it\n\n## should be noted that increasing protein intake to 1.6 g/kg/day in women on bed rest\n\n## for 60 days was shown not to prevent muscle loss, while a positive effect was observed\n\n## when combined with aerobic and resistance exercises [ 73 ]. Therefore, it is important to\n\n## emphasize that protein intake can prevent muscle loss, especially when combined with\n\n## exercise interventions during the rehabilitation process.\n\n## In addition to total protein intake, balanced distribution of the daily protein intake in\n\n## each meal is also important. For example, consumption of a moderate amount of protein\n\n## in each meal (breakfast: 31.5\u00b11.3 g, lunch: 29.9\u00b11.6 g, and dinner: 32.7\u00b11.6 g of\n\n## protein) stimulated 24-h muscle protein synthesis 25% more effectively than skewing the\n\n## protein intake toward the evening meal (breakfast: 10.7\u00b10.8 g, lunch:16.0\u00b10.5 g, and\n\n## dinner: 63.4\u00b13.7 g of protein) [ 74 ]. In another study, it was reported that consumption of\n\n## 20\u201325 g (0.30 g/kg) provided more muscle protein synthesis compared with consumption\n\n## of 0, 5, and 10 g and similar to that for 40 g [ 75 ]. Thus, consuming such amounts of\n\n## protein intake (20\u201325 g/meal) should be recommended for healthy athletes. However, the\n\n## amount of protein in meals should also be increased for further protein synthesis during\n\n## the injury period. When increasing protein intake, the amino acid content should also be\n\n## considered. In particular, the amount of leucine, one of the keystones of protein synthesis,\n\n## is important [ 76 ], given that leucine helps anabolic stimulation by overcoming resistance to\n\n## protein synthesis. Indeed, leucine intake was reported to delay muscle loss in rats during\n\n## immobilization [ 77 ]. However, the effects of extra leucine intake in immobilized humans\n\n## are not incompletely explored. Additionally, future research is needed to determine the\n\n## amount of leucine to be consumed by athletes during the rehabilitation process.\n\n## 4.2. Creatine\n\n## In addition to the well-documented effects of creatine, including improving strength,\n\n## increasing lean muscle mass, and helping the muscles recover more quickly during exercise,\n\n## creatine can also be beneficial in reducing muscle atrophy in athletes during immobilization\n\n## after injury [ 78 ]. For example, Hespel et al. [ 7 ] reported that consumption of creatine\n\n## monohydrate (from 20 g down to 5 g daily) in combination with rehabilitation exercises\n\n## for 10 weeks (3 days/week) accelerated muscle hypertrophy in disuse atrophy induced by\n\n## 2 weeksof leg immobilization [ 7 ]. In another study, Op\u2019t Eijnde et al. [ 9 ] investigated the ef-\n\n## fects of creatine monohydrate consumption on muscle glucose transporter type4 (GLUT4)\n\n## levels during2 weeksof immobilization and the following 10 weeks of rehabilitation train-\n\n\n## ing with resistance exercises [ 9 ]. Creatine monohydrate consumption of 20 g/day during\n\n## the immobilization process attenuated the decrease in GLUT4 levels, and consumption of\n\n## creatine monohydrate during the training period (15 g for the first 3 weeks and 5 g for the\n\n## last 7 weeks) increased the GLUT4 levels by 40% [ 9 ]. Taken together, loading and mainte-\n\n## nance doses of creatine can be recommended during immobilization and rehabilitation for\n\n## the maintenance of muscle mass and metabolic health.\n\n## 4.3. Omega-\n\n## Recent research shows that fish oil plays a significant role in preventing muscle loss.\n\n## For example, the consumption of fish oil pills for 10 consecutive days in immobilized rats\n\n## alleviated muscle atrophy by stimulating the protein kinase B pathway in the immobilized\n\n## soleus muscle [ 79 ]. Intake of fish oil for 5 weeks also improved insulin sensitivity in muscle\n\n## protein metabolism in red angus [ 80 ]. However, no study to date has investigated whether\n\n## a similar beneficial effect of fish oil pills is evident in immobilized humans. Of the limited\n\n## studies, Smith et al. [ 81 ] reported increased anabolic responses to insulin and amino acids\n\n## following 8 weeks of omega-3 intake in healthy young and middle-aged individuals. In\n\n## physically active individuals, the consumption of 3900 mg fish oil (containing 3 g n-3) for\n\n## 4 weeks decreased muscle damage [ 82 ]. Although fish oil consumption is promising in\n\n## reducing muscle loss due to muscle injuries, more studies involving human participants\n\n## are needed.\n\n## 4.4. Antioxidants\n\n## Due to therapeutic roles in improving exercise-induced muscle damage, there has been\n\n## a significant scientific inquiry into antioxidants. In particular, antioxidants such as vitamins\n\n## C and E come to the fore in the fight against increased production of reactive oxygen species\n\n## after muscle injury [ 83 ]. However, there are contradictions in the literature regarding the\n\n## intake of antioxidants after muscle damage, as the therapeutic effects of antioxidants in\n\n## conditions such as inflammation, loss of strength, fatigue, and cell damage have not been\n\n## fully elucidated yet [ 84 ]. Moreover, some research reported increased muscle damage when\n\n## antioxidants were consumed following muscle damage due to the prevention of cellular\n\n## adaptation after exercise [85].\n\n## Taken together, although there is no study directly examining the effects of nutrition\n\n## on muscle injuries in combat sports, it is recommended to increase the daily protein and\n\n## leucine intake, consume creatine at a loading and maintenance dose, and intake omega-\n\n## supplements to reduce muscle loss.\n\n## 5. Nutrition in Joint, Connective Tissue, and Tendon Injuries\n\n## Joint, tendon, and connective tissue injuries are among the most frequent injuries\n\n## after superficial tissues and skin injuries in combat sports [ 2 ]. These injuries can impair\n\n## performance and lead to immobilization. The repair of joints, tendons, and ligaments is\n\n## not fully elucidated compared with muscle repair [ 86 ], yet current evidence suggests that\n\n## Collagen supplements and supplements that support collagen synthesis, such as gelatin\n\n## and vitamin C, are the most prominent strategies in these cases.\n\n## 5.1. Collagen\n\n## Collagen, a connective tissue protein, is the primary component of tendons and\n\n## ligaments [ 87 ]. Collagen is rich in glycine, proline, hydroxylysine, and hydroxyproline,\n\n## and consumption of these amino acids increases collagen synthesis [ 88 ] as well as improves\n\n## the ligament\u2013tendon structure [ 89 , 90 ]. Though collagen synthesis in tendons and muscles\n\n## is not affected by the increase in amino acid intake [ 91 ], consumption of an amino acid\n\n## content rich in proline, hydroxylysine, and hydroxyproline improves collagen synthesis [ 92 ].\n\n## Indeed, cell culture studies showed that hydrolyzed collagen significantly increases type\n\n## 2 collagenbiosynthesis as well as stimulates the regulation of the collagen cycle in cartilage\n\n\n## tissue [ 93 ]. In an animal study, it was shown that oral intake of hydrolyzed type 1 collagen\n\n## peptides improved the size and composition of collagen fibrils in a tendon cell [94].\n\n## Collagen also plays a protective role in joint and connective tissue health, as well as\n\n## reducing joint pain. For example, consuming 25 mL of liquid collagen containing10 gof\n\n## hydrolyzed collagen per day for 24 weeks improved joint health and reduced the risk of\n\n## joint degeneration and joint pain compared with a placebo [ 8 ]. In athletes with chronic ankle\n\n## injuries, significant reductions in the number of ankle injuries were observed following\n\n## ingestion of 5 g of collagen peptide for 6 months [ 11 ]. Collectively, intake of 10\u201315 g of\n\n## hydrolyzed collagen per day appears to be an effective strategy for the prevention and\n\n## treatment of joint, tendon, and ligament injuries.\n\n## 5.2. Gelatin\n\n## Ample evidence shows that gelatin stimulates collagen synthesis. Gelatin, obtained\n\n## by boiling the skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments of animals such as cows, pigs, and fish,\n\n## has the same amino acid content as collagen [ 23 , 86 ]. Gelatin was reported to be beneficial\n\n## in collagen production and returning to the field from an injury [ 86 ]. For example, the\n\n## consumption of 15 g of gelatin 1 hour before a 6-min jump rope test performed to stimulate\n\n## collagen synthesis was shown to increase collagen synthesis twofold by raising the collagen-\n\n## 1 amino terminal pro-peptide in the blood [ 95 ]. When the intake of 15 g of hydrolyzed\n\n## collagen and gelatin was compared in the same protocol, a similar positive effect was found\n\n## for the procollagen levels [ 96 ], suggesting positive and similar effects for the consumption\n\n## of 15 g of gelatin or hydrolyzed collagen 30\u201360 min before exercise [95,96].\n\n## 5.3. Vitamin C\n\n## Consuming vitamin C together with collagen amino acids also improves collagen\n\n## synthesis [ 92 , 95 ]. Vitamin C is a pivotal player in collagen synthesis, and its deficiency\n\n## causes scurvy, which in turn results in collagen loss. Vitamin C is a cofactor of proline\n\n## 4 hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in proline hydroxylation and procollagen synthesis\n\n## in connective tissues [ 97 ]. Furthermore, adequate vitamin C intake with collagen is of\n\n## significant importance given that vitamin C provides an increase in collagen synthesis,\n\n## tendon and ligament repair, and improvement in surgeries. At least 46 mg/day of vita-\n\n## min C intake is the minimal dose required to maintain collagen production [ 23 ], but the\n\n## effects of a higher intake on collagen synthesis remain to be determined. Citrus fruits,\n\n## strawberries, kiwi, peppers, and broccoli are some of the foods rich in vitamin C that\n\n## should be consumed [ 98 ]. Of the limited studies available, Shaw et al. [ 10 ] investigated the\n\n## effects of 24 weeks of evidence-based supplementation of gelatin (10 g/day) and vitamin\n\n## C (250 mg/day) along with creatine (loading: 20 g\u00d75 days immediately postoperative,\n\n## then 3 g/day) and leucine (3 g/day) on the leg strength and muscle mass in two elite rugby\n\n## union players with ruptured their left anterior cruciate ligaments, which were repaired\n\n## with traditional hamstring grafts. They reported that rehabilitation programs combined\n\n## with this type of nutrition strategy could attenuate leg strength loss due to 24 weeks of\n\n## physical inactivity. Among the very limited studies investigating the therapeutic role of\n\n## nutrition in joint, connective tissue, and tendon injuries, none were conducted with combat\n\n## athletes. However, the consumption of 10\u201315 g of collagen or gelatin containing vitamin\n\n## C following a joint-connective tissue injury is likely to provide significant support for the\n\n## prevention and treatment of these injuries.\n\n## 6. Nutritional Strategies in Bone Injuries\n\n## Since combat sports involve striking, throwing, or immobilizing an opponent, the\n\n## main cause of injuries in combat athletes is mechanical energy leading to musculoskele-\n\n## tal injuries [ 2 , 99 ]. Studies reported that the proportion of fractures is greater in mixed\n\n## martial arts (27%), wrestling (21.3%), and kickboxing, in which fracture rates may reach\n\n## 20% [100,101]. In addition, one of the most common bone injuries in athletes is stress frac-\n\n## tures, which are different from contact fractures [ 102 ]. Stress fractures are overuse injuries\n\n\n## of the bone that result from the repeated application of stress lower than that required to\n\n## fracture the bone in a single loading session [ 103 ]. Although the pathophysiology of stress\n\n## fractures is not fully understood, it is considered to occur due in part to insufficient nutrient\n\n## intake [104].\n\n## 6.1. Vitamin D and Calcium\n\n## Although there is a limited number of studies that investigated the association of\n\n## diet with prevention of or recovery from bone injuries, it is fairly well-known that diet\n\n## exerts a profound effect on bone health. For example, providing sufficient calcium and\n\n## vitamin D plays a significant role in optimal bone formation during healing from fractures.\n\n## Additionally, Barker et al. [ 105 ] reported an association of low vitamin D levels with\n\n## impaired recovery from knee surgery. It was demonstrated that if an individual has\n\n## sufficient vitamin D, supplementation may be detrimental, especially when used after a\n\n## bone fracture because certain macrophages might be suppressed [ 106 ]. Lappe et al. [ 107 ]\n\n## documented that supplementation with 800 IU/day of vitamin D and 2000 mg of calcium\n\n## reduced the risk of developing stress fractures in female navy recruits. However, an\n\n## excessive amount of micronutrient intake during recovery from injury remains a matter of\n\n## debate. Protein, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and fluoride play important roles in\n\n## bone health [ 108 ]. Iron, zinc, silicon, vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamins C and B are other\n\n## nutrients supporting metabolic processes important for bone tissue [ 109 , 110 ]. From this\n\n## point of view, adequate intake of dairy products, fruits, and vegetables, specifically green\n\n## leafy vegetables, is beneficial a source for the main nutrients that support bone health.\n\n## 6.2. Energy Intake\n\n## One of the more specific considerations in nutritional strategies for preventing bone\n\n## injuries in combat sports is RWL practices [ 58 ]. As discussed above, RWL practices may\n\n## impair athletes\u2019 health in multiple ways. A common practice of RWL in weight-classed\n\n## athletes is to extremely reduce dietary intake, which might result in a hormonal imbal-\n\n## ance [ 65 , 66 ], which in turn acutely affects bone metabolism. Hence, there are concerns\n\n## that dietary strategies used by athletes to achieve RWL are very likely to lead to a low\n\n## energy availability (EA) state and nutrient deficiency, which are known to negatively affect\n\n## bone metabolism and increase the risk of bone injuries [ 111 \u2013 113 ]. Low EA is a state of\n\n## insufficient energy intake to support the physiological functions required to maintain opti-\n\n## mal health [ 114 ], and it can be observed in both female and male athletes [ 112 ]. Ihle and\n\n## Loucks [ 115 ] reported that an energy intake under a threshold of 30 kcal/kg of fat-free mass\n\n## (FFM) daily results in disruptions in the hormonal markers of the reproductive system\n\n## and bone metabolism in females. Given that combat athletes lose weight several times\n\n## a year, their bone health will be negatively affected. Therefore, maintaining an EA of\n\n## 45 kcal/kg/FFMper day is recommended in order to optimize bone health and prevent\n\n## bone injuries.\n\n## There has been an increase in the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets among athletes\n\n## in recent years [ 116 ]. This remains a matter of debate, as carbohydrate intake provides\n\n## the largest contribution to the daily total energy intake in the athlete\u2019s diet. Nevertheless,\n\n## losing weight by manipulation of glycogen stores is a common method used among combat\n\n## athletes [ 61 ]. Furthermore, it is worth noting that these dietary approaches are likely to\n\n## increase the risk of a low-EA state due to carbohydrate restriction. Although some recent\n\n## data have shown that low carbohydrate availability might negatively affect bone health\n\n## independent of EA [117], more research is needed on this topic.\n\n## 6.3. Protein Intake\n\n## Protein should be also considered when recovering from bone injuries. Athletes\n\n## are generally recommended to consume protein at a rate of more than 0.8 g/kg/body\n\n## mass daily [ 118 ]. Considering that protein is one of the key components in bone, it is\n\n## important for athletes to consume sufficient amounts of protein. On the other hand, some\n\n\n## research suggested that high protein consumption could be detrimental to bone due to the\n\n## associated acidic load [ 119 ]. In contrast, recent meta-analyses that investigated the effect of\n\n## protein on bone health showed that there were no adverse effects of higher protein intake\n\n## on bone health [ 120 , 121 ]. Instead, there might be some beneficial effects on bone health,\n\n## particularly when combined with a sufficient calcium intake [ 23 ]. On the other hand, bone\n\n## collagen synthesis, an important factor for bone healing, responds to increased amino\n\n## acid levels [ 122 ]. Studies reported that protein supplementation enhanced recovery from\n\n## hip fracture surgery [ 123 , 124 ]. However, since these results are based on data obtained\n\n## from elderly subjects, further studies should investigate whether these effects of protein\n\n## supplementation are present in healthy athletes.\n\n## 7. Nutrition in Sports-Related Concussions (SRCs)\n\n## SRCs are mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) global health concern and caused by\n\n## a biomechanical force to the body which causes temporary deterioration of neurological\n\n## functions [ 125 ]. TBIs are common in contact sports [ 126 , 127 ]. According to the position\n\n## statement released by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine about concussions\n\n## in sports, protective equipment does not provide sufficient protection from the incidence\n\n## or severity of concussions in sports [ 128 ]. Hence, there is a need for divergent strategies\n\n## capable of preventing or reducing the deleterious effects of SRCs and subconcussive impacts.\n\n## From this point of view, nutritional supplementation could be valuable when provided\n\n## before and after TBIs, and this is a fruitful area of research for future studies.\n\n## Nutritional recommendations for TBIs are centered around antioxidants and anti-\n\n## inflammatory agents [ 125 , 129 ]. When a TBI is sustained, neuroinflammation and dysreg-\n\n## ulation of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and calcium (Ca2+) ions occur, and the influx\n\n## of Ca2+ions leads to oxidative stress [ 130 ]. Curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound,\n\n## was shown to be effective in reducing the levels of oxidized proteins and normalizing\n\n## brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats following TBIs [ 131 ]. In addition, there\n\n## are many studies investigating the effects of n-3 fatty acids on TBIs [ 132 \u2013 134 ]. Data from\n\n## animal studies demonstrated that supplementation of n-3 fatty acids decreased neuronal\n\n## damage and inflammation and normalized BDNF and neurotransmitter levels [ 132 \u2013 134 ].\n\n## Although both n-3 fatty acids and curcumin seem to be effective in the treatment of TBIs,\n\n## solid recommendations cannot be made, and further human research is needed. A review\n\n## by Trojian et al. [ 129 ] suggested that lower serum levels of vitamins D, C, or E before\n\n## injury worsen the outcomes in animal studies and that caffeine intake after SRCs could be\n\n## detrimental. For a detailed discussion on nutritional supplements for the treatment and\n\n## prevention of SRCs, readers may be referred to the recent reviews by Trojian et al. [ 129 ] and\n\n## Lust et al. [125].\n\n## 8. Preoperative Nutritional Strategies\n\n## Both the inflammatory response to the injury and surgical stress lead to catabolic reac-\n\n## tions [ 135 ]. The release of injury-induced stress hormones and proinflammatory cytokines\n\n## may sustain a prolonged catabolic state characterized by nitrogen loss [ 136 ] and insulin\n\n## resistance [ 135 ]. Hyperglycemia occurs despite elevated levels of insulin, exacerbating the\n\n## depletion of muscle protein [ 135 ]. Thus, adequate intake of macro- and micronutrients is\n\n## required to support this hypermetabolic state and the injury-healing process [ 12 ]. Tradi-\n\n## tionally, preoperative nutrition was mainly focused on recommendations about fasting and\n\n## restricted fluids beginning at midnight of the day of the operation [ 137 ]. An empty stomach\n\n## minimizes the risk of pulmonary aspiration. However, more recent data showed that these\n\n## fasting routines can be replaced with less strict ones without putting patients at risk [ 12 , 135 ].\n\n## Furthermore, providing high-carbohydrate beverages to patients immediately before oper-\n\n## ations was shown to be safe and to reduce the catabolic stress of surgery [ 138 , 139 ]. Indeed,\n\n## nutritional supplements known to support the immune system, which in turn diminishes\n\n## the catabolic response to operation and maximizes recovery potential, are safe for use\n\n## before surgery [ 12 , 138 ]. On the operation day, a liquid consisting of high molecular weight\n\n\n## starch and essential amino acids is recommended 2 or 4 hours prior to surgery [ 12 ]. In\n\n## addition, given that midnight fasting results in significant depletion of the glycogen stores\n\n## known to increase the demand for amino acids, preoperative carbohydrate drinks may\n\n## reduce the risk of insulin resistance by maintaining and improving the whole-body protein\n\n## balance and muscle function [138].\n\n## Moreover, hyperglycemia may increase the risk of postoperative complications. In this\n\n## regard, a 100-g glucose intake with an oral solution the night before surgery and 50 g of\n\n## glucose 2 h before surgery were reported to reduce postoperative hyperglycemia [ 12 , 139 ]. In\n\n## addition, modified waxy maize starch could be used as a preoperation supplement to help\n\n## maintain glucose levels during surgery as well as to prevent postoperative hypoglycemia.\n\n## In summation, it is important for athletes to consume adequate complex carbohydrate\n\n## sources and proteins the night before surgery to minimize postoperative complications.\n\n## 9. The Role of Nutrition in Returning to a Sport Following Injury\n\n## Injuries are prevalent in combat sports, and many injuries lead to time loss and\n\n## absence from sports, including both training and competing. The return of athletes to\n\n## sports following injury will depend on the injury classification and the cooperation of\n\n## different disciplines, including sports medicine, sport psychology, and sports nutrition.\n\n## Although nutritional interventions are often overlooked and not commonly a standard of\n\n## care in rehabilitation interventions, providing athletes with appropriate sports nutrition\n\n## consulting during the injury process is a pivotal factor that can augment the recovery\n\n## process and support healing. Hence, nutritional interventions should be coordinated with\n\n## the different phases of the recovery process to optimize the healing process. In this section,\n\n## we will focus on nutritional strategies that play important roles in the rehabilitation phase\n\n## for athletes following an injury.\n\n## 9.1. Nutrition in Immobilization and Atrophy\n\n## Periods of immobilization caused by injuries are often associated with the loss of\n\n## muscle mass and strength, which are deleterious for health and performance [ 140 , 141 ].\n\n## Despite studies reporting muscle disuse atrophy following long experimental periods\n\n## ranging from 2 to as long as 17 weeks of bed rest or limb immobilization [ 142 , 143 ], some\n\n## studies reported profound impacts from only a few days of disuse on the skeletal muscle\n\n## mass and strength [ 141 , 144 ]. Therefore, muscle mass recovery following injury-induced\n\n## atrophy could be critical for combat athletes to accelerate a safe return to sports. Although\n\n## one of the best ways to recover muscle mass is exercise interventions (i.e., resistance\n\n## training), this is not always applicable. Therefore, reliable nutrition strategies can help to\n\n## limit muscle wasting and maintain muscle mass in these situations [ 145 ]. Indeed, adequate\n\n## total energy intake and appropriate dietary intake are the main nutritional strategies during\n\n## the rehabilitation of injured athletes, along with the intake of some supplements that have\n\n## the potential to help [23].\n\n## It is well-documented that muscle protein breakdown accelerates during injury re-\n\n## covery to support increased protein requirements due to wound healing and tissue re-\n\n## building [ 12 , 146 ]. However, optimizing healing is more dependent on the intake of protein\n\n## than the bodily breakdown of protein. Therefore, increasing dietary protein seems to be\n\n## an effective strategy during this process. Furthermore, given that the decrease in lean\n\n## body mass is of particular concern due to its role in all protein synthesis necessary for\n\n## healing, nutritional strategies, especially increasing protein intake, have key importance\n\n## both to increase lean body mass synthesis and to improve healing by increasing protein\n\n## synthesis [ 146 ]. However, research yielded equivocal results, with some studies reporting\n\n## benefits [ 147 , 148 ] while others reported no benefits [ 149 , 150 ]. For example, a recent system-\n\n## atic review by Pasiakos et al. [ 151 ] reported that protein supplementation did not enhance\n\n## the recovery of muscle function during recovery, suggesting that sufficient dietary protein\n\n## provided in the general diet of an athlete might be enough and with no additional protein\n\n## intake required to prevent muscle injury. It is noteworthy that despite the findings of this\n\n\n## study, increased dietary protein is an adjunct therapy to attenuate muscle atrophy and\n\n## promote repair following an injury, which in turn accelerates a safe return to sports [ 23 ].\n\n## Collectively, injured athletes should consider maintaining protein intake to reduce muscle\n\n## mass loss during the healing process [152].\n\n## There are several other nutrients known to promote healing following an injury,\n\n## including vitamins C, D, and E, creatine, glycine, polyphenols, flavonoid, and branched-\n\n## chain amino acids (BCAAs). Although it is not fully explored, some researchers advocate\n\n## that vitamins C, D, and E work either by acting as an antioxidant or through a reduction\n\n## in inflammation [ 23 ]. For example, it was shown that vitamins C and E can decrease\n\n## recovery time, but it remains to be elucidated whether these vitamins can optimize the\n\n## healing process [ 153 , 154 ]. Research has also questioned whether increasing dietary glycine\n\n## could accelerate the healing of tendons in rats [ 155 , 156 ] and marathon runners [ 157 ]. The\n\n## findings showed that a diet containing 5% glycine, which is extremely high and not realistic\n\n## for consumption, increased collagen and mechanical strength in rats [ 155 ]. In contrast,\n\n## Buncman et al. [ 157 ] reported that 10 g of glycine supplementation (3 times/week for\n\n## 2 weeks) did not heal skeletal muscle injuries in young male and female marathon runners.\n\n## The use of glycine in athletes following true injury has not been fully explored, and\n\n## therefore, clinical studies are needed for further insights. Moreover, although there was no\n\n## consensus reached [ 158 ], some studies reported that BCAAs such as leucine, isoleucine, and\n\n## valine can boost healing after a musculoskeletal injury as well as increase protein synthesis\n\n## and inhibit protein breakdown [ 159 , 160 ]. In particular, considering leucine is an essential\n\n## amino acid found in greater amounts in proteins and is required for optimal stimulation of\n\n## the rate of muscle protein synthesis [ 161 ], the ingestion of leucine in a mixture of essential\n\n## amino acids during healing can reverse an attenuated response of muscle protein synthesis.\n\n## However, given that there is little research in this area of sports nutrition, clinical studies are\n\n## needed to determine whether these supplement-based strategies can influence the recovery\n\n## process of injured athletes.\n\n## 9.2. An Obvious Nutrient to Be Avoided after Injury: Alcohol\n\n## Large amounts of alcohol consumption after training and competition are part of\n\n## the social aspects of many sporting events [ 162 ]. Research has documented that it is\n\n## very likely that athletes consume alcohol above the threshold classified as hazardous\n\n## drinking [ 163 , 164 ]. Given that consumption of alcohol is associated with mental distress-\n\n## related factors [ 165 ], one can assume that sports competition and overwhelming training\n\n## periods might be a factor in the increasing consumption of alcohol among athletes through\n\n## the effect of these factors. Although many of the molecular processes disrupted by alcohol\n\n## are typically known, studies investigating the mechanisms of alcohol-induced tissue injury\n\n## are rare. A complete consideration of the literature is beyond the scope of this review.\n\n## Thus, interested readers are referred to other reviews [ 166 , 167 ]. Overall, as pointed out by\n\n## a review paper [ 13 ], alcohol is an obvious nutrient best avoided after injury. Accumulating\n\n## evidence shows that alcohol ingestion can impair muscle protein synthesis and wound\n\n## healing likely by reducing the inflammatory response [ 168 \u2013 170 ] and can increase lean\n\n## body mass loss during immobilization [ 171 ]. It was also shown that alcohol ingestion\n\n## suppressed the elevated rates of muscle protein synthesis induced by exercise and protein\n\n## ingestion in young, active males [ 168 ] and the fracture repair process in rats [ 172 ]. Indeed,\n\n## alcohol consumption after exercise and injury is likely to have a detrimental effect on the\n\n## athlete\u2019s recovery due to not eating or resting adequately as a result of intoxication [ 168 , 173 ].\n\n## Moreover, it is worth noting that increased blood flow to the injury site is likely to worsen\n\n## the severity of the injury and adversely affect the rate and outcome of healing. Therefore,\n\n## abstinence from alcohol consumption to limit blood flow to the site of the injury is routinely\n\n## advised due to the known vasodilatory effect of alcohol [ 167 , 173 , 174 ]. Taken together,\n\n## limited alcohol ingestion among athletes during the training period and healing process is\n\n## vital for a safe return to sports. The effects of alcohol on recovery and the time to return to\n\n## sports following injuries in athletes remains a fruitful area of investigation.\n\n\n## 9.3. Energy Intake Following Injury\n\n## The main goal during a phase of restricted training due to injury should be to maintain\n\n## physical capacity via sustaining cardiovascular capacity and muscle mass and minimization\n\n## of undesired body fat increases [ 175 ]. Following an injury, there is an inevitable reduction in\n\n## athletic activities, even if not stopped completely, to allow the injuries to recover, which in\n\n## turn results in reduced energy expenditure (EE). This reduction in EE consequently requires\n\n## a concomitant reduction in energy intake to prevent gains in body fat [ 23 ]. Considering\n\n## carbohydrates are an essential part of many athletes\u2019 daily energy intake during hard train-\n\n## ing periods, it would be appropriate to reduce carbohydrate intake during inactivity [ 176 ].\n\n## However, it should be noted that there should not be a drastic reduction in energy intake\n\n## for injured athletes, since the healing process leads to a substantial increase in EE [ 177 ],\n\n## especially early and if the injury is severe (i.e., by up to as much as 50%) [ 13 , 178 ], depending\n\n## on the type and severity of the injury. In particular, the EE of athletes using crutches was re-\n\n## ported to increase two- to threefold [ 179 ]. Furthermore, given that performing some form of\n\n## exercise for the non-injured limb(s) is a common practice among athletes, a proper balance\n\n## between EE and energy intake during the healing period should be sought. Importantly,\n\n## energy intake during immobilization is known to exert a profound effect on muscle protein\n\n## synthesis [ 13 ]; that is, a negative energy balance would result in reduced muscle protein\n\n## synthesis and greater losses in functional strength and prolong the time before returning to\n\n## sports [ 12 ]. Therefore, maintaining an energy balance, specifically a high-protein intake,\n\n## is critical to attenuate the loss of lean body mass. Injured athletes can minimize weight\n\n## and fat gain while still meeting the nutritional needs of recovery with a diet including a\n\n## greater proportion of protein in combination with complex carbohydrates [ 12 ]. Although\n\n## weight and fat gain are the main concerns among athletes during the healing process, it\n\n## would be an appropriate strategy to maintain the macronutrient composition via a diet\n\n## with a 2:1 carbohydrate-to-protein ratio (e.g., 240 g of carbs and 120 g of protein), which\n\n## was shown to promote positive changes in body composition [ 180 \u2013 182 ]. In this regard,\n\n## careful planning is needed to ensure that sufficient energy from macronutrient nutrition is\n\n## consumed during recovery from an injury.\n\n## 10. Conclusions\n\n## Injuries will happen to athletes as an inevitable consequence of sports. In this regard,\n\n## nutrition solutions that can reduce the risk of injury, as well as decrease recovery time,\n\n## should be carefully implemented. Athletes should be encouraged to seek advice from expe-\n\n## rienced staff with up-to-date knowledge of nutritional strategies in the athletic population.\n\n## As a divergent field among sports disciplines, combat sports are contact sports involving\n\n## one-on-one combat that engage in full contact to score points, to cause an opponent to\n\n## submit, or to disable an opponent in a contest or match. Because of this nature, the risk of\n\n## injury is higher in combat sports (i.e., 7.8 injury/1000 min of exposure) compared with most\n\n## other sports. Therefore, providing evidence-based nutritional strategies that could reduce\n\n## the risk of injury as well as optimize the healing process is a pivotal factor for minimal risk\n\n## of injury and a safe return to sports. Furthermore, given that chronic low energy availability\n\n## is a major risk factor for bone injuries, athletes should maintain their energy balance such\n\n## that the energy intake (total kcal consumed) equals the EE (total kcal expended). Thus,\n\n## change in energy demands should be carefully monitored during the training, competition,\n\n## and recovery periods. Additionally, preventing RWL and consuming sufficient protein\n\n## are of significant importance for bone health, particularly in anabolic resistance in muscle\n\n## during combat sports. In addition to the protective effects of anabolic resistance, a sufficient\n\n## protein intake plays a primary role in the maintenance of lean muscle mass and is an\n\n## important predictor of muscle strength, power, balance, exercise tolerance, weakness, and\n\n## fatigue. In this respect, increasing the daily protein intake in combination with exercise,\n\n## balanced distribution of protein intake among meals, and consuming protein with a high\n\n## content of leucine will be effective strategies for optimal performance and recovery.\n\n\n## In terms of the maintenance of muscle mass and metabolic health, creatine supplemen-\n\n## tation seems to improve strength and maintain lean muscle mass during the immobilization\n\n## and rehabilitation process. Moreover, although the published literature is not as abun-\n\n## dant for other supplements as for creatine, there is growing interest in the role of fish\n\n## oil consumption, calcium, and vitamin C, D, and E supplementation in reducing muscle\n\n## loss and inflammation associated with injuries during the recovery period. In addition,\n\n## vitamin C provides an increase in collagen synthesis, tendon and ligament repair, and\n\n## improvement in surgery outcomes. Thus, an adequate vitamin C intake (\u226546 mg/day)\n\n## should be reached to maintain collagen production. Also, consuming hydrolyzed collagen\n\n## (10\u201315 g/day) is an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of joint, tendon, and\n\n## ligament injuries. In particular, consumption of gelatin or hydrolyzed collagen 30\u201360 min\n\n## before exercise is beneficial for collagen production. Moreover, due to their role in reducing\n\n## oxidized proteins, neuronal damage, and inflammation as well as normalizing BDNF\n\n## and neurotransmitter levels in animal models, n-3 fatty acids and curcumin are likely to\n\n## be effective nutritional supplements during the healing process. Despite accumulating\n\n## evidence, however, more studies involving humans, specifically athlete populations, are\n\n## needed to better understand the possible benefits of these supplements for the prevention\n\n## of injury or recovery of injured athletes.\n\n## Notably, as a part of preoperative nutrition, it is important to provide athletes with an\n\n## adequate amount of macro- and micronutrients and nutritional supplements that support\n\n## the immune system. This will likely meet the demands of the catabolic state and contribute\n\n## to the injury-healing process. In this respect, consumption of complex carbohydrates and\n\n## proteins the night before surgery is recommended to minimize postoperative complications.\n\n## Additionally, alcohol ingestion should be limited due to its potential adverse effects on\n\n## muscle protein synthesis and wound healing, as well as weight gain and lean body mass\n\n## loss during immobilization. Considering the majority of the findings about the role of\n\n## nutrition in injury recovery come from animal studies or clinical human studies, further\n\n## high-quality studies, particularly from more diverse populations, specifically athletes,\n\n## are needed.\n"

The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp,\nand time between weigh-in and competition are factors influ-\nencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16\npoints constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the\nResearch Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports\nhave differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and\ncompetition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and\nweight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the\nduration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of\nthe aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic\npathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-\noutput bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation\nphase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to\n15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements\nincluding creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-\nmethylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance\nperformance and/or recovery during preparation phases, com-\npetition, and post-competition. 5.

Individual caloric needs can be deter-\nmined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such\nas Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prior-\nitized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean\nbody mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports\ntraining demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the\nfollowing: carbohydrates 3.0\u20134.0 g/kg, protein 1.2\u20132.0 g/kg, and\nfat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range\nfrom 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to\nweigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective\nfor inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight\nweek, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through\nexercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2%\nloss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber\nintake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute\nwater loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion,\nand mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate\nsupervision (optimally ~2\u20134% of body mass within 24 h of\nweigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are\nutilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition\nwith the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral\nrehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with\na sodium range of 50\u201390 mmol/dL should take precedence\nimmediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at\na tolerable rate of \u2264 60 g/h should follow oral rehydration\nsolutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to\navoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate\nintake at 8\u201312 g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes\nthat undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies dur-\ning fight week. About 4\u20137 g/kg may be suitable for modest\ncarbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refuel-\ning protocols should aim to regain \u226510% of body mass to\nmitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of\nrapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight\ncuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating\nfurther research.\n1.Methods\nThis position stand focuses on nutritional recommendations that are specific to MMA and\ncombat sports. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using three databases:\nPubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. The following combination of search terms were\nused for each individual database: combat sports, acute weight cut strategies, bioener-\ngetics, fiber depletion, heat acclimation, water loading, glycogen status, hydration, sports\nnutrition, and nutrient timing. Articles were included if they were peer-reviewed and/or\noriginal research. Although few published studies address the complexities and unique\ntraining demands of combat sports, relevant articles were selected, regardless of any\nmethodological limitations. The studies were categorized based on the core phases of\ncombat sports: general preparation/off camp, fight camp, fight week, and rehydration/\nrefueling.\n## 2A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\n2.Introduction\nCombat sports have a long history, yet organized scientific study is still in its infancy.\nSeveral combat-related sports can be traced back to the ancient Olympic games: includ-\ning armored foot races, boxing, wrestling, and throwing events. These combat sports\nknown as \u201cpankration\u201d entered the 33rd Greek Olympic Games circa 688 BCE [1]. Over the\ncenturies, various disciplines evolved from the ancient art of pankration, such as wrestling,\njudo, kickboxing, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai, and now two of the world\u2019s more popular\ncombat sports: Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and Brazilian jiu Jitsu. The recent growth and\nglobal interest in combat sports and MMA can be largely attributed to the establishment\nof the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993 [2]. Currently, in its 31st year, the\nUFC is estimated to generate over a billion dollars per year [3,4]. Furthermore, the UFC has\nfacilitated the growth of numerous other MMA organizations and has also increased\ninterest in other combat sport disciplines like Brazilian jiu-jitsu [5]. With the increasing\npopularity of the sport, higher participation rates, and greater earning potential, coaches\nand fighters are motivated to improve skill acquisition and enhance their physiological\ncapacities. Recognizing the needs of modern combat athletes, the UFC Performance\nInstitute was established specifically to offer evidence-based services in strength and\nconditioning, testing, nutrition counseling, weight cut supervision, post weigh-in rehy-\ndration and refueling strategies, and post-fight recovery.\nThe intent of this position statement is to review existing literature on combat sport\ndisciplines, with a specific focus on identifying best practices for general preparation, fight\ncamp/longitudinal weight descent, fight week, post weigh-in recovery, and post-fight\nhealth and well-being. While there is ample research available on optimal dietary prac-\ntices for athletes in various sports, there is a noticeable lack of data specifically tailored to\ncombat sports. This is particularly true when it comes to determining the most effective\npractices for longitudinal weight descent during fight camp, fight week preparation, and\npost weigh-in recovery. As a result, this position statement places special emphasis on\nmixed martial arts (MMA), where combat athletes have a pre-day weigh-in. Consequently,\nthe recovery period after a weigh-in can range from 24 to 36 h before the fighter enters\nthe cage, mat, or ring. However, consideration is also given to sports, such as Brazilian jiu-\njitsu, and wrestling, where weigh-ins occur less than 24 h before or on the same day as the\ncompetition, often with only a 1\u20132 h window between stepping off the scale and\ncompeting on the mat.\n3.Professional overview\nCombat sports and MMA present numerous variables to consider when formulating\nnutritional strategies, including both foreseeable and unforeseen factors. For example,\nthe bioenergetics and energy requirements across MMA and combat sports disciplines are\nlargely commensurate with the phases of preparation, and the athletes\u2019 total body mass.\nFactors such as weight class, training styles, volumes, and intensities, may necessitate\nindividualized adjustments with dietary planning. The preparation requirements, duration\nof competitions, and weigh-in regulations will vary across fight disciplines [6]. In MMA,\nexceedingly high training volumes are necessary due to the interdisciplinary nature of the\nsport, where different styles must be trained concomitantly [3]. MMA fighters must\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION3\n\npossess sound techniques in punching, kicking, wrestling, jiu jitsu, and Muay Thai. This\nleads to potential increases in training volume and intensities, which in turn influence\nenergy and recovery demands. It is essential to differentiate between the bioenergetics\nand energy demands of training for competition vs. the competition itself. For example, at\nthe professional level, most MMA fights consist of three rounds lasting 5 min each, with\na 1-min rest interval between rounds. In contrast, fight preparation can involve four to\n5 h a day of intensive training [3].\nIt is also critical to consider that nutritional strategies during camp may need to be\nmanaged according to the weigh-in regulations of the sport (Table 1). In general, both\namateur and professional MMA, boxing, kickboxing, and Olympic judo offer 24-to-36-h\nwindows between the weigh-in and the time the athlete enters the cage, mat, or ring.\nMost national, international, and Olympic competitions (e.g. wrestling and Brazilian jiu\njitsu) require the athlete to weigh-in less than 24 h before a match, or on the same day,\noften with only 1\u20132 h to recover before competition. These weigh-in windows will require\ndifferent methods for each athlete to reach their competitive weight. MMA, boxing, and\nkickboxing emphasize reducing body fat and relying on rapid weight loss and acute water\nloss techniques in the final 24\u201348 h before the weigh-in. This is immediately followed by\nreplenishing fluids, electrolytes, and an emphasis on carbohydrate intake in the subse-\nquent 24\u201336-h window. In contrast, other combat sports have a smaller recovery window\nof 1\u20132 h. This is an extremely important differentiating factor as those combat athletes\nwith a 1\u20132-h recovery time will not be able to deploy the same type of acute water loss\nstrategies and rehydration practices as those with longer recovery windows. Hence,\nathletes competing with same-day weigh-ins such as wrestling or jiu jitsu may need to\nhave a greater reliance on the loss of body fat and regulation of lean tissue mass to qualify\nTable 1.

Nutritional and weight cut strategies are reviewed throughout this paper\nwith a specific focus on practices for those disciplines with a longer weigh-in and recovery\ntime such as MMA. However, the following considerations are addressed for those with\ncombat disciplines with different post-weigh-in recovery times (Table 1).\n4.Bioenergetics\nThree energy systems intersect to initiate and regulate the generation of adenosine tripho-\nsphate (ATP): the adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine (i.e. ATP-PCr or phosphagen)\nsystem, the glycolytic (lactic acid or fast glycolysis) system, and the oxidative systems (i.e.\naerobic or oxygen) [7]. The ATP-PCr and glycolytic systems are considered anaerobic, while the\noxidative system is known to be aerobic. The ATP-PCr system is metabolically powerful due to\nthe rapid transfer of energy in a brief time frame. The glycolytic system provides energy\nthrough the body\u2019s digestion of carbohydrates; however, this process is more metabolically\ncostly. Lastly, the oxidative energy system utilizes oxygen to break down carbohydrates, fats,\nand, in times of high metabolic demands or low energy availability, proteins. Each of these\nenergy systems offers a differing amount of energy release and is intensity dependent [7].\nRecognizing the role of each energy system in a specific sport is essential for adequately\npreparing athletes to optimize their performance during competitions through effective\ndietary practices, supplementation, training, and recovery protocols see Table 2 [8].\nCombat athletes not only require elevated levels of cardiorespiratory endurance for\nsustained performance, but also need explosive knockout power for striking, as well as the\nnecessary strength for effective takedowns and manipulation of their opponents [9].\nDetermining the exact energy systems and fuel mixtures in real-time is challenging as\nattaching accurate metabolic measuring devices to the athlete is likely to hinder perfor-\nmance or pose a risk of injury. Simulated fight scenarios in a laboratory setting partially\naddress this issue through the measurement of effort-pause ratios. By using effort-pause\nTable 2.

Research\nconducted in simulated fight bouts across different fight disciplines has provided valuable\ninsights into the energy systems and substrate utilization.\n4.1.Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)\nMMA requires extremely high energy metabolic demands, and it does so across all three\nenergy systems. The sport may be best categorized as \u201ca high-intensity intermittent sport\nin which force must be repeatedly exerted against an external resistance in the form of an\nopponent\u201d [3].\nThe bioenergetic demands of MMA require managing the mixing of the alactic, fast\nglycolytic, and aerobic energy systems. Previous work comparing high-level and low-level\nmartial artists showed that successful grappling- and striking-focused athletes have\ngreater anaerobic energy system(s) efforts [10\u201315]. The variations in anaerobic output\n(ATP-PCR vs Glycolytic) between strikers and grapplers underscore the differences in\nwork-rest ratios inherent in their respective sports, but other factors such as the pace of\na fight/match could exert influence. In striking combat sports, Muay Thai and kickboxing\nexhibited work-to-rest ratios of 2:3 and 1:2, respectively, which aligns with the character-\nistics of the ATP-PCR energy system [16]. In grappling sports, such as judo, a greater work-\nto-rest ratio has been measured at 3:1, which is suggestive of the glycolytic energy system\n[17]. Similarly, a 3:1 ratio was identified in Greco-Roman wrestling [18]. The work-to-rest\nratios of both striking and grappling sports rely heavily on the anaerobic system for high-\nintensity periods while oxidative pathways contribute to the recovery of anaerobic\nactivity. The larger work-to-rest ratio seen in grappling sports explains the longer-term\nand longer-bouts of anaerobic efforts seen among high-level grapplers [19,20]. The work-\nto-rest ratio in MMA has been measured between 1:2 and 1:4 (excluding intervals\nbetween rounds), which is midway between striking and grappling sports and displays\na combination of both ATP-PCR and glycolytic anaerobic energy system contributions\n[21,22]. While bouts lasting 15 to 25-min demand a heightened level of cardiorespiratory\nfitness (i.e. oxidative energy system), MMA athletes attempt to deliver impactful strikes or\nengage in grappling and wrestling which may necessitate a superior degree of strength,\npower, and muscular endurance. In other words, the outcome of a fight in MMA can be\ndecided by the ability to optimally engage in intermittent bursts of maximal exertion\nwithin brief time frames.\nIn title fight bouts, MMA athletes compete for a maximum of 25 min (5 \u00d7 5-min rounds).\nEach round may consist of high-intensity periods of action lasting from 6 to 36 s [23]. This\nis combined with episodes of lower-intensity action that may last two to three times as\nlong. Notably, however, knockouts and TKOs occur in these high-intensity areas of\nactivity, making these explosive efforts critical to success [3]. Moreover, the MMA athlete\u2019s\nmetabolic capacity may be influenced by factors such as the demands of the weight cut,\npost weigh-in recovery, the pace of the fight, the fighting styles, and which opponent is\ndictating the style and pace of the fight. Hence, numerous factors will influence the\nenergy requirements of MMA training or competition. No studies to date have accurately\nmeasured the caloric expenditure of full-training sessions or a mock three-round fight.\nResearch across various combat sport disciplines has mostly focused on Olympic sports.\n## 6A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nAlthough the translation of findings from other combat sport disciplines may not offer\nexact parallels to the bioenergetic demands of an MMA match, it does offer valuable\ninsights into the caloric expenditure and distribution of energy system utilization.\n4.2.Karate\nDuring the 2020 Olympic Games, karate was one of the striking sports that was\nrepresented [24]. Beneke et al. [25] used excess post-exercise oxygen consumption\n(EPOC) and blood lactate measures during a simulated fight to analyze karate\nathletes. After 36 matches, consisting of 2\u20134 fights per athlete with a mean duration\nof 275 \u00b1 61 s and 9-,15-, and 17-min intervals between matches, it was demonstrated\nthat these fights had 77.8 \u00b1 5.8% contribution from the oxidative system, 16.0 \u00b1 4.6%\nfrom the ATP-PCr system, and 6.2 \u00b1 2.4% from the glycolytic system. The total\nobserved energy expenditure was 81.4 \u00b1 19.5 kcals. These findings suggest that\nduring a karate fight, athletes rely predominantly on oxidative metabolism while\nstill receiving support from anaerobic systems. Beneke et al. [25] concluded that\nathletes who were most efficient at utilizing the ATP-PCr energy system were the\nmost effective at executing actions during the fight and those who maintained\nglycolytic power throughout the fight made the most offensive actions. In agree-\nment, Doria et al. [26] also showed that the oxidative system (74 \u00b1 1%) was the\npredominant energy system in karate. The researchers observed that the ATP-PCr\nsystem contributed 14 \u00b1 3% and the glycolytic system contributed 12 \u00b1 2% during\na karate match, with a total expenditure of 72.8 kcals \u00b16 kcals. During this study,\nthey also compared sex differences and found that males relied more on oxidative\ncontributions when compared to females.\nLoturco et al. [27] completed a case study on a male karate athlete, who is a double\nworld champion, the athlete performed a simulated karate bout. Their findings again\naligned with the previous work of Beneke and Doria in that they reported an energy\nexpenditure of 88.5 kcals, 31% of energy production was derived from the glycolytic\nsystem while the oxidative system contributed 61%.\n4.3.Taekwondo\nCampos et al. [28] reported a 66 \u00b1 6% contribution from the oxidative system, 30 \u00b1 6%\ncontribution from ATP-PCr, and 4 \u00b1 2% from the glycolytic system in taekwondo athletes\nduring a simulated match. In each round, there was a mean expenditure of 43 \u00b1 7 kcal. In\naddition, the contribution of energy systems varied in each round. In round one, the\noxidative system (23 \u00b1 3 kcal) compared to round 2 (30 \u00b1 3 kcal) and round 3 (32 \u00b1 4 kcal).\nThe contribution from the glycolytic system also decreased from the first round (2.6 \u00b1 0.9\nkcal) to the third round (1.5 \u00b1 1.1 kcal). The first round required less energy expenditure\n(38 \u00b1 4 kcal) compared to the second (43 \u00b1 4 kcal) and third (49 \u00b1 7 kcal) rounds. To\nmaintain the same level of technical action, the athletes expend more energy in the\nlater rounds than in the first, which indicates a decrease in efficiency. The only overall\nchange in energy systems was a lower contribution from the glycolytic system in the first\nround (7 \u00b1 2%) versus the last round (3 \u00b1 3%). The ATP-PCr system had an equal contribu-\ntion across all three rounds, indicating that the 1-min interval of rest was sufficient for\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION7\n\nreplenishing phosphocreatine stores. The high energy demand in taekwondo is mainly\nmet by the ATP-PCr system, which provides energy to sustain repeated striking attacks\ninvolving both the upper and lower body [28].\n4.4.Judo\nJulio et. al. [29] examined the energy system contribution in grappling sports. During this\nstudy, the authors reported that the oxidative system contributed 70%, while the ATP-PCr\nsystem contributed 21% and the glycolytic system provided 8% of the energy needed\nduring the match duration. Their total energy expenditure was 84 \u00b1 22 kcal. By assessing\nthe onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) and VO\n## 2\nPeak for upper and lower body\ncycle ergometry, they observed some shifts in metabolic systems. During a match, the\nenergy consumption of a judo athlete appears to be between their VO\n## 2\nPeak and their\nOBLA. The researchers found a lower oxidative system contribution in 1-, 2-, and 3-min\nmatches compared to those of longer duration. The shorter matches showed a greater\nreliance on the ATP-PCr system, and longer matches used greater oxidative contributions.\nThe glycolytic system remained constant throughout the length of the matches. Power\nwas seen to be notably higher while rest time was lower in the 1-min matches compared\nto the longer matches. This indicates that nutritional and training interventions should be\naimed at maintaining metabolic power over time to improve performance.\n4.5.Boxing\nDavis et al. [30] simulated an Olympic boxing match consisting of three rounds, each\nlasting 3 min. They showed that the oxidative system contributed 86% to energy produc-\ntion while ATP-PCr contributed 10%, and the glycolytic system contributed 4%. The\nboxers were reported to be at 97\u2013100% of their VO2Peak during the last 20 s of each\nround. The contribution of the oxidative energy system was lowest during the 1st round\n(30 \u00b1 4.8 kcal) compared to the 2nd and 3rd rounds (33.8 \u00b1 5.7 kcal and 33.6 \u00b1 6.8 kcal,\nrespectively), while the glycolytic system was highest during the 1st round (3.2 \u00b1 0.9 kcal)\nwith concomitant decreases for the 2nd and 3rd round (1.9 \u00b1 0.6 kcal and 1 \u00b1 0.8 kcal,\nrespectively). Interestingly, the boxers were able to maintain the same total number of\noffensive attacks per round. The authors suggest the energy demands are slightly lower\ncompared to a competitive bout which would shift metabolic demands to slightly more\nanerobic but still predominantly aerobic. However, Davis et al. [30] concluded that these\nphysiological and energy system responses to the boxing match indicate that the athletes\nwere metabolically efficient, and they exhibited a high level of aerobic fitness, as seen by\ntheir ability to supply ATP through oxidative pathways rather than glycolytic flux during\nthe rounds.\n4.6.Muay Thai\nCrisafulli et al. [31] examined ten experienced competitive Muay Thai athletes during\na simulated match consisting of three rounds (3 min per round) with a 1-min rest period\nbetween rounds. This is consistent with many amateur Muay Thai bouts. The investigation\nshowed that the average heart rate and oxygen uptake for all athletes were above those\n## 8A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nrespective values when evaluated at lactate threshold for all three rounds. However, even\nthough the heart rate and oxygen consumption slightly decreased during the 1-min\nperiod between rounds, they remained above the lactate threshold and thus did not\nallow for full recovery. The athletes\u2019 efforts beyond levels of aerobic metabolism produced\nincreases in CO\n## 2\nproduction because of the body\u2019s shift toward anaerobic processes,\nwhich is intricately linked to the observed rise in blood lactate. This indicates a meaningful\nrelationship between the two. This also served as an indirect index of glycolysis. The\nresearchers showed that after an initial increase, the excess CO\n## 2\npeaked in the first round\nand subsequent rest period, and there was a continual increase on the reliance of the\naerobic system. Therefore, glycolysis predominated early in the match and then progres-\nsively waned as the contribution of the aerobic system increased in the following\nrounds [20].\n4.7.Jiu jitsu/wrestling\nWrestling, submission grappling, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu are commonly integral parts\nof an MMA match, yet this can be contingent on the disciplines and styles of the\nfighters competing. The sport of wrestling is likely to place a significant demand on\nall energy systems. Ohya et al. [32], purported that the technical and tactical\nrequirements of wrestling, coupled with the muscle-strength andpower demands\non both the upper and lower body, foster the use of both the anaerobic and\naerobic energy systems. The anaerobic system provides the quick bursts of maximal\npower during the match, whereas the aerobic system contributes to the wrestler\u2019s\nability to maintain effort for the duration of the match and to recover between\nperiods [32].\nA study by Mirzaei et al. [33] investigated the energy systems in Greco-Roman and\nFreestyle wrestlers participating in the 2015 and 2016 World Championships. Energy\ncontributions remain comparable across weight classes in both the Freestyle and\nGreco-Roman wrestlers [33]. The study found that glycolytic/lactic acid system con-\ntributed the most in energy release during a single wrestling match, which repre-\nsents the anaerobic nature of wrestling. Additionally, the results showed that the\nnature of Freestyle is more dynamic than Greco Roman, because Freestyle wrestlers\ncan use all the Greco-Roman techniques as well as leg attacks by using arms and\nlegs actively. Indeed, Kraemer et al. [34] reported that large increases in lactate (up\nto 20 mmol/L) occurred during a five-minute college freestyle match, which is\nassociated with reductions in power production and fatigue. In contrast, the authors\nof this review cited that maximal treadmill tests only raise lactate to approximately\n10 mmol/L.\nHowever, factors such as the duration and intensity of the match, skill level, level of\ncompetition, and movement efficiency may significantly influence the relative contribu-\ntion of each system. Accordingly, determining the precise contribution of each energy\nsystem in wrestling matches remains challenging.\nA recent study by Pessoa Filho et al. [35] investigated the metabolic demands of\na single six-minute no-gi sparring match with 10 advanced no-gi grapplers. Their inves-\ntigation reported approximately 28% of energy contribution was derived from the ATP-\nPCr, and approximately 72% was derived from anaerobic energy contributions. While the\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION9\n\ninvestigators did not measure aerobic contributions, they asserted that matches of\nsustained lengths would have a greater reliance on aerobic metabolism. The authors\nalso noted that differences in the style of an individual jiu jitsu competitor, the level of\ncompetition, perceived stress, and opponent effort, potentially influenced energetic\npathway utilization.\n4.7.1.Bioenergetics summary\nIn summary, combat sports involve high-intensity actions that are metabolically demand-\ning, so athletes must have good metabolic flexibility and efficiency. Research on martial\narts has generally found that the energy demands of an average karate fight lasting 4 min\nand 27 s come from aerobic (77.8%), anaerobic alactic (16.0%), and lactic (6.2%) energy\npathways [25]. Moreover, the existing research is consistent; independent of the combat\nsport discipline, as the duration of the match increases, the contribution of the aerobic\nsystem increases, yet anaerobic alactic pathways remain vital for executing high output\nbursts of skill applications. It is important to note that sports nutrition professionals\nshould be aware of the numerous factors that can influence energetic demands, energy\nexpenditure, and ultimately metabolic cost. With an understanding of the complex\ninteraction of energy systems, sports nutrition professionals can effectively manage the\ntotal daily energy expenditure requirements based on the combat athletes training\nvolumes, intensities, and body composition, and adjust the calories and macronutrients,\nas necessary.\n5.Combat sports \u2013 preparation phases\nAs noted, combat sports are a group of contact activities in which fighters engage in one-\non-one physical contests depending on a specific set of rules for competition. Combat\nathletes can strike, kick, hit, throw, punch, or grapple with their opponent, depending on\nthe ruleset, with the aim of trying to score more points by disabling their rivals and\nstopping them from continuing the match [36]. The physical stresses of combat athletes\nare highly individualized and vary based on the demands of their training specialty\n(jujitsu/boxing/grappling), weight class, and the timing of the next match. Phases of\ncombat sports are generally separated into three distinct phases: \u201cOff camp\u201d or general\npreparation, \u201cfight camp\u201d and \u201cfight week\u201d/post weigh-in. General preparation is com-\nmonly referred to as \u201coff camp.\u201d As the name implies, this phase occurs between fights\nand outside of a formalized fight camp. This phase should focus on improving aerobic\ncapacity, advancing skills, developing strength and power, and maintaining an appro-\npriate body mass and body composition. Fight camps, on the other hand, are eight-to-ten\n-week periods of time where the fighter works extensively on advancing multidisciplinary\nskills that target tactical strategies, and specifically advancing the requisite bio-motor\nqualities needed to be successful in competition. This often involves two to three daily\ntraining sessions, which are done commensurate with the longitudinal weight descent.\nFinally, fight week requires the fighters, coaches, and sports nutrition professionals to\nstrategically manage skill sessions and manipulate nutritional and weight cut strategies,\nwhich include adjusting caloric intake, carbohydrate reductions, and water loading.\nAdditionally, fighters utilize acute water loss strategies such as dry sauna, hot water\n## 10A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nimmersion, and mummy wraps. At the professional level, many of these practices during\nfight week must be managed with numerous press and media obligations.\n5.1Off camp/general \u2013 preparation phase\nThe \u201coff camp\u201d phase occurs between fights and precedes the formalized fight camp. This\nphase, which can vary in length, should focus on advancing aerobic capacity, technical\nskills, developing strength and power, and maintaining an appropriate body mass and\nbody composition.\n5.1.1.Body mass and weight\nCombat athletes may benefit from maintaining adequate levels of aerobic fitness along\nwith managing their body mass and body composition during the general preparation\nphase; especially as it pertains to health and performance. In this respect, an athlete\u2019s\n\u201cwalk-around weight\u201d is an important metric outside of fight camp. Walk-around weight is\ngenerally defined as the athlete\u2019s weight outside of the fight camp measured against their\nweight class. It is estimated that combat athletes lose an average of 5% body mass during\nrapid weight loss [37]. Garthe et al. [38] reported minimal losses in performance measures\n(1-repetition-maximum (1RM) tests, 40-m sprint, and countermovement jump) in indivi-\nduals engaged in weight loss at rates of 0.7% per week. Based on typical loss during RWL\nand weekly body mass loss of 0.5\u20131% over an 8-week camp, the authors suggest that the\nideal maximum walk-around weight should range from 12% to 15% above the athlete\u2019s\ndesired weight class. The authors speculate this will minimize decreases in performance\nwhile allowing the athlete to make the weight of their desired class. In context, this would\nhave a UFC male middleweight, required to make 185Ibs for their weight division,\nsustaining a weight of 207Ibs\u2013212Ibs in the off camp phase. However, these numbers\nhave not yet been fully substantiated through research and while there is scant research\non this notion, practical application suggests this range should be effective for\na longitudinal weight descent that simultaneously supports conditioning, skill training,\nand recovery. During fight camp, the athlete will utilize dietary and exercise strategies\nthat create a caloric deficit to decrease body mass and must ensure this deficit does not\nnegatively impact training performance, overall health, and any potentially harmful long-\nterm metabolic adaptations. Although 12\u201315% may be potentially optimal, larger reduc-\ntions in body mass are common practice in combat sports [39].\nMoreover, research has shown large decreases in testosterone below clinical reference\nranges (<5 mmol\u00b7L\n## \u22121\n), as well as a decrease in resting metabolic rate, when losing 13\u201315%\nbody mass over an 8-week camp [40]. Accordingly, the ranges of 12\u201315% body mass\nabove the weight class may be the upper limits of a suitable longitudinal weight descent.\nCombat athletes exceeding 12\u201315% body mass will require more significant energy\nrestriction, and if completed over a shorter duration than 8 weeks, the caloric deficit\nneeded to achieve the desired changes in body mass may put athletes at a greater risk for\nlow energy availability. While much of the available literature on low energy availability\nhas indicated systemic reductions in various hormones, the impact of these energy\ndeficits may also result in negative changes related to skill acquisition, concentration,\nmotivation, and recovery [41]. This is a critical area for future research, which aims to\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION11\n\nidentify suitable losses in body mass that will allow for sustained longitudinal health and\nperformance for combat athletes.\n5.1.2Energy requirements and macronutrients\nLike many other types of athletes, the success of combat athletes is highly\ndependent on their ability to consume adequate energy to meet the demands of\nmultiple daily training sessions. Daily energy needs are based on the athlete\u2019s body\nmass, body composition, training volumes, goal weight, and total daily energy\nexpenditure (TDEE). The caloric needs of elite combat athletes engaged in moder-\nate to high-intensity training differ significantly from those of the general popula-\ntion. To maintain weight, athletes must balance caloric intake with total energy\nexpenditure, so determining TDEE with reasonable accuracy is necessary. Metabolic\ncarts and indirect calorimetry are the most accurate methods to determine\na combat athlete\u2019s resting metabolic rate (RMR). In the absence of these modalities,\ntotal energy expenditure can be calculated using the Mifflin \u2013 St Jeor equation,\nwhich considers age (years), sex, height (cm), weight (kg), and an estimate of the\nathlete\u2019s physical activity level (PAL) [42,43]. The Cunningham equation can also be\nused which determines BMR via, BMR (kcal/day) = 500 + 22 \u00d7 (lean body mass). The\nCunningham equation determines the energy required at rest by considering lean\nbody mass instead of overall body weight and then factoring in the combat\nathlete\u2019s physical activity level. Another simple estimate of total energy expendi-\nture is to multiply the athlete\u2019s weight (lbs.) by 14 and add the estimated calories\nburned by training and the thermic effect of food [43], which is typically 3% to\n10% of calorie expenditure [44]. These methods provide a reasonable estimate for\ncaloric expenditure which should then be adjusted to best match the combat\nathletes\u2019 current body mass, training demands, and for the maintenance of\na desired weight and body composition.\nCombat athletes meet their caloric requirements by consuming adequate amounts of\ncarbohydrates, protein, and fat. Carbohydrate requirements vary significantly based on\nbody mass, the type of workout, training intensity, and the training phase in which they\nare engaged [43]. Generally, combat athletes should anticipate consuming between 3 to\n5 g of carbohydrates per kg of body mass daily for light activity and between 8 to 12 g of\ncarbohydrates per kg of body mass daily for intense training [43]. Although research\nsuggests 8\u201312 g of carbohydrate per kg of body mass may be required for endurance\nathletes, this amount is likely to be excessive for combat athletes competing in\na weight-specific sport. However, one should not overestimate the merit of consuming\nthese amounts for post weigh-in refueling. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, sweet\npotatoes, rice, pasta, and legumes are recommended sources of carbohydrates during\nthe \u201coff camp\u201d phase, instead of processed sugars [43].\nFat requirements for the combat athlete are the same as nonathletes and should be\n20\u201335% of total daily calories or approximately 1.0 g of fat for every kilogram of body\nmass per day. While being the most energy-dense nutrient, dietary fat is a common target\nfor people who need to restrict energy intake; however, consuming daily fat intake below\n15\u201320% of total calorie intake is not advised [45]. However, fats are often restricted during\nlongitudinal weight descents to meet the restriction in calories while preserving carbohy-\ndrate and protein intakes. Optimal fat sources include salmon, lean meats, eggs, nuts and\n## 12A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nnut butters, avocado, coconut, and olive oil [43], and not saturated or trans fats from fried\nfoods, processed cheeses, or hydrogenated oil.\nProtein requirements range from a minimum of 1.2 g per kg of body mass per day and\nup to 2.4 g of protein per kg of body mass or 15% to 30% of total calories [43] which is\na higher intake relative to the average sedentary individual [46,47]. In addition to promot-\ning muscle recovery and enhancing muscle protein synthesis, increased protein intake\nresults in favorable changes in body composition, especially when in an energy deficit. It is\nimperative to meet protein requirements since, unlike fats and carbohydrates, there is\na limited storage pool of proteins and their constituent amino acids. If combat athletes are\nnot meeting protein requirements via sufficient food intake, protein supplementation in\nthe form of protein powders or ready to drink beverages might be needed to achieve\nadequate energy and protein needs. The sports nutrition professional can assist combat\nathletes in building proper meals that meet energy and macronutrient demands, with\nstrategically timed windows around their training sessions.\nAlthough micronutrients are considered essential for optimum health, their ability to\nfunction as ergogenic aids is unlikely [43], mainly when overt deficiency was present\nbefore vitamin and mineral supplementation. Nonetheless, studies have highlighted that\nconsuming a multivitamin can help athletes meet their daily micronutrient needs, which\nare higher compared to the general population [48].\n5.1.3.Periodized nutrition\nAnother emerging area of research is \u201cperiodized nutrition,\u201d which refers to the strategic\nuse of specific nutritional interventions to support exercise performance [49]. This is not\na new concept. It is well established that protein should be consumed post-exercise, as\nthis can optimize net protein synthesis. However, most nutritional recommendations for\nathletes aim to promote acute recovery after exercise and are not specific regarding the\ntype of training or intensity [49]. Pairing specific nutritional goals commensurate with the\nphases of training may be beneficial for the combat athlete whose nutritional needs\nextend beyond recovery [49]. For example, protein needs should be based on increasing\nor maintaining a suitable body composition in the general preparation phase. Moreover,\nprotein needs should be tailored to recovery and minimizing loss of lean body mass\nduring fight camp. The authors recommend creating individualized nutrition and training\nprograms, ideally before the start of fight camp, and adjusting as needed.\n5.1.4.Assessment\nPrior to entering fight camp, it is important to conduct a thorough assessment of the\nspecific demands of the combat sport discipline and the individual athlete\u2019s needs. An\nassessment enables the training team to determine which nutritional strategies should be\nimplemented for the combat athlete and what needs to be achieved before fight camp.\nInformation such as the athlete\u2019s anthropometrics, previous weight cut practices, the\nnumber and duration of weight cuts, and current dietary intake (including supplementa-\ntion) should be assessed. Daily food logs or dietary tracking apps are accessible to most\nindividuals and are ideal for assessing and monitoring dietary intake. The combat athletes\u2019\nprevious practices can be measured against an evidence-based approach and revised\nwhen warranted.\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION13\n\nWhile there are numerous measures that may have utility in optimizing performance\nthrough nutritional interventions. The sports nutrition professional may be most con-\ncerned with data including resting metabolic rate (RMR), body composition including fat-\nfree mass (FFM), body fat percentage, and total body water (TBW). First, this data may\nassist in developing nutrition strategies that will meet the energy demands for combat\nathletes through all phases of training. Additionally, via determining total body mass and\nfat-free mass, predictive equations can be used to establish the feasibility of the combat\nathlete competing in their weight division. While there are no specific validated equations\nfor predicting the efficiency and safety of longitudinal weight descents, the UFC\nPerformance Institute has developed the Weight Making Preparedness Score (WMPS).\nThe equation requires data on Fat-Free Mass, the athlete\u2019s Total Mass over the target\nweight, Fat Mass, and Resting Metabolic Rate. The equation can be found on pp. 242 of\nthe Cross-Sectional Performance Analysis of the UFC Athlete, vol. 2.\nThis data may also have utility for determining the required rate of a longitudinal\nweight descent in fight camp; and for monitoring any potential deviances in resting\nmetabolic rate. Accordingly, the sports nutrition professional may track these measures\n(body composition and resting metabolic rate) and adjust nutritional strategies as needed\nto ensure adequate energy intake and an efficient longitudinal weight descent.\nThere are various methods available for testing body composition, which can be used\nby researchers and trainers. Common methodologies for measuring body composition\ninclude hydro-densitometry, air displacement plethysmography, multifrequency bioelec-\ntrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), ultrasound, 3D scanning, skinfold thickness, and dual-\nenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [50] Each method has its own strengths and weak-\nnesses, as assessed by researchers. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is considered\none of the most accurate methods for assessing body composition. DXA provides infor-\nmation on total and regional fat mass, fat-free mass, percent fat, and bone mineral density\n[51]. Additionally, DXA can provide limb-specific estimations of fat mass and fat-free mass,\nwhich is useful for measuring and tracking injury/recovery and fat loss for weight cutting\n[52,53]. Essential DXA measurements for combat athletes include body composition\nanalysis, muscle-fat analysis, and obesity analysis. It should be noted that DXA, as with\nall modalities, is subject to confounding results from inter-assessment differences in\nhydration, glycogen and muscle creatine levels, all which can vary significantly in combat\nathletes [54].\nBioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an inexpensive and reliable assessment tool\nused for body composition. Unlike DXA, BIA estimates total body water, which can be\nuseful for estimating the impact of fluid loss on pre- and post-training and pre- and post-\nweight-in. Important BIA measurements to consider in combat athletes are body compo-\nsition analysis, muscle-fat analysis, and obesity analysis. Compared to DXA, BIA has been\nshown to underestimate fat mass and overestimate fat-free mass [51,55\u201360]. Despite this\nvariability in findings with BIA, it can still be considered a useful tool for measuring body\ncomposition change, which is especially important for sports nutrition professionals\nassessing directional change [51,55,61].\nAs part of a comprehensive assessment, when possible, blood analysis screenings may\nprovide insight into a combat athlete\u2019s health and performance. Blood work is often used\nas a screening tool to identify potential deficiencies in vitamins, minerals and micromin-\nerals such as iron, as well as evaluating oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally,\n## 14A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nblood work can provide the status of red blood cell populations as well as markers such as\ncortisol and creatine kinase, which can provide insights into overtraining, readiness to\ntrain, and other measures such as protein turnover [62]. Biomarkers such as vitamin D and\niron are well established and commonly assessed, whereas others need further research\n(e.g. fatty acids) to demonstrate their utility in sport [62]. Newer methods that estimate\nplasma volume using groups of biochemical markers are also showing promise. Such\nmarkers may provide additional support for monitoring a combat athlete\u2019s adaptation to\ntraining.\n5.1.5.Performance supplementation\nSupplementation with various dietary ingredients is a widespread practice for many\nathletes to heighten performance and augment training adaptations. While research on\ncombat sport athletes is limited, some evidence is available which suggests certain\ningredients may enhance their performance. The phase of training or preparation\nwhereby an athlete may choose to utilize a certain dietary supplement is an important\nconsideration. For many supplements, utilizing them during a general preparation phase\nis a prudent consideration. This allows for experimenting with a given supplement and\nthe dosing to optimize the effects on the combat athlete. Some supplements, however,\nrely on their accumulation in skeletal muscle (e.g. creatine, beta-alanine, etc.) to exert their\nergogenic effects. In these situations, the off-camp/general preparation phase allows for\na sufficient window of time for these supplements to reach ergogenic levels.\nNotwithstanding these considerations, the following supplements may be considered\nfor their ability to augment performance and recovery potential of combat athletes:\nCaffeine [63], beta-alanine [64], sodium bicarbonate [65], creatine [66], and nitrates\n[67,68]. In addition, supplements such as essential amino acids [69], leucine [70], [71],\nbranched-chain amino acids [72\u201374], and \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate [75], may promote\nincreases in protein synthesis or decrease delayed onset muscle soreness.\nCaffeine is a long-standing supplement in the realm of athletic performance. Caffeine\nuse has been shown to improve physical and cognitive performance in several sports due\nin large part to its ability to modulate central and peripheral nervous system activity [63].\nSeveral studies support the use of caffeine among combat athletes [76\u201378]. A systematic\nreview conducted by Lopez-Gonzalez et al. [79] found that supplementation with 3\u20136 mg/\nkg of caffeine increased the glycolytic contribution (as evidenced by increased blood\nlactate concentrations) to energy metabolism during the execution of real or simulated\ncombat bouts. Caffeine supplementation also improved levels of strength, power, and\nupper arm muscular endurance, and these effects were not associated with an increase in\nthe perceived exertion by the athlete [80].\nA systematic review by Lopes-Silva & Franchini in 2021 [81] examined the isolated and\ncombined effects of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO\n## 3\n) and \u03b2-alanine (BA) supplementation\non the performance of combat sports athletes. The results showed that acute and chronic\nisolated ingestion of NaHCO\n## 3\nand chronic BA are effective in improving performance in\nthe Wingate test, Upper Wingate test, Special Judo fitness test and Karate-specific aerobic\ntest, which translates to advancing combat sports athlete\u2019s performance via muscle\nfunctionality and localized muscle buffering capacity. Additionally, the co-ingestion of\nBA and NaHCO\n## 3\nresulted in additional improvements across testing. However, the authors\nfound no benefit to taking these supplements individually.\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION15\n\nHalz et al. [82] conducted a study with 16 elite judo athletes (21.8 \u00b1 2.5 years old) where\nathletes were randomly assigned to receive either BA (4 g/d over the first 2 weeks and 6 g/\nd in the last 2 weeks) or placebo for 4 weeks. Before and after BA supplementation, the\nathletes completed two double 30-s upper and lower limb Wingate tests, separated by\n3 min. The results showed that BA supplementation significantly improved lower and\nupper limb total work and upper limb mean power during the Wingate test. However,\nthere were no significant differences in lower limb mean power in the BA group when\ncompared to the placebo group. These authors concluded that chronic BA supplementa-\ntion effectively enhances high-intensity intermittent upper- and lower-body performance\nin highly trained judo athletes.\nCreatine monohydrate is one of the most studied supplements in human performance,\nand its safety and efficacy are indisputable [83,84]. Studies consistently demonstrate\npositive ergogenic effects on single and multiple bouts of short-duration, high-intensity\nexercise activities, in addition to enhancing exercise training adaptations after creatine\nsupplementation. These qualities are crucial to success in MMA [85\u201387]. Another pro-\nposed benefit of creatine, which is vital for sustaining the training volumes and intensities\nassociated with combat sports, is the facilitation of glycogen replenishment. Roberts et al.\n[87] confirmed the ability of creatine supplementation to enhance post-exercise muscle\nglycogen storage during a conventional and rigorously controlled carbohydrate-loading\nregimen in humans. Additionally, creatine may also provide benefits for MMA athletes by\nmitigating the effects of traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and ongoing therapeutic applica-\ntions are now being examined [88]. Doses ranging from 5 to 10 g/daily are generally\nrecommended for enhancing performance, however research is indicating that higher\ndoses may be warranted for the potential neuroprotective effects.\nDelleli et al. [89] conducted a systematic review on the effects of beetroot juice\n(nitrates) on performance in combat athletes. While this review did not assess the effects\nof combat sports skills, it showed that nitrates may improve oxidative metabolism and\nforce production for combat sports athletes. Effects may vary based on the population,\nintake duration, muscle group activated, and exercise type.\n\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methyl-butyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of leucine that is formed through \u03b1-\nketoisocaproate. Recently, Tartibian and Rezaei [68] demonstrated that HMB supplementa-\ntion significantly improves physiological recovery markers, attenuates muscle damage, and\nenhances recovery by modulating cortisol, IGF-1 levels, and perceived recovery status in\nelite wrestlers following a simulated wrestling protocol. Durkalec-Michalski et al. [90]\ndemonstrated that HMB supplementation significantly improves body composition and\nenhances both aerobic and anaerobic capacities in highly trained combat sports athletes\nover 12 weeks without affecting blood markers [91]. In a study by Hung et al. [92], it was\nfound that short-term oral supplementation of three grams per day of HMB for 3 days can\nreduce body fat in well-trained female judo athletes undergoing energy restriction, without\naffecting lean body mass or exercise performance. In support, Chang et al. [93] found that\nHMB supplementation during acute weight loss in well-trained boxers can preserve fat-free\nmass and maintain heart rate response during simulated matches, without significantly\naffecting glucose, fat, and protein metabolism under energy restriction. The exact mechan-\nism of action is not clear, but it is believed that HMB has an anti-catabolic effect (possibly by\nsparing leucine) and promotes anabolic action [94]. These anti-catabolic effects can be\nparticularly beneficial during fight camp when training volumes and intensities are\n## 16A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nincreased, and caloric intake is decreased for weight-loss purposes. The literature suggests\nthat a dosage of 1\u20133 g (38\u201340 mg/kg) of HMB can be beneficial [94,95].\nEssential amino acids (EAAs) can play a vital role in fostering muscle protein synthesis\nin combat athletes [96]. Essential Amino Acids cannot be synthesized de novo in humans\nand must be supplied by diet. Essential Amino Acids ingestion in free form in approxi-\nmately ten-gram doses or as part of a protein bolus of 20\u201340 g after exercise are known to\nstimulate muscle protein synthesis [97]. From these results, consuming EEAs could\nincrease strength and improve body composition by increasing lean body mass, and\npreserving lean mass during the longitudinal weight descent of the combat athlete [98].\nA well-balanced diet may provide sufficient micronutrients, but combat athletes who\npractice rapid weight-loss or eliminate whole food groups may be at risk of nutrient\ndeficiencies [43]. Additionally, the high training loads of fight camps and elevated\nenergetic demands are believed to lead to an increase in micronutrient needs [48].\nSupplementation with basic micronutrients may be warranted.\nThe sports nutrition professional may consider these supplements as part of the\ntraining practices of combat athletes. Therefore, remaining abreast of the current research\nwill aid the sports nutrition professional in deciding which supplements have the highest\nefficacy and utility for the combat sport athlete. It is vital that the sports nutrition\nprofessional recommend supplements that have been third-party tested to meet label\nclaims and be free of banned substances.\n5.1.6.Off camp \u2013 general preparation phase \u2013 practical applications\n## \u25cf\nThe general preparation phase is a time to improve aerobic fitness, improve skills,\nand optimize physical qualities such as strength, power, speed, and mobility.\n## \u25cf\nAnecdotally, combat athletes\u2019 maximum walk-around weight should range from\n12\u201315% above their desired weight class.\n## \u25cf\nDetermining the combat athlete\u2019s resting metabolic rate and TDEE is imperative for\nmaintaining an optimal weight and pairing energy and nutrient demands to training\nvolumes and intensities.\n## \u25cf\nCombat athlete\u2019s protein requirements range from 1.2\u20132.4 g/kg, with amounts closer\nto 2 g/kg being considered a target intake.\n## \u25cf\nWhile 8\u201312 g Carbohydrates/kg body weight has been recommended for athletes\ncompleting high volumes of endurance exercise, a range of 4-5 g Carbohydrates/kg\nbody weight may be an appropriate starting intake for combat sports athletes once\nmatched with TDEE in the general preparation phase.\n## \u25cf\nThe general preparation phase is an ideal time to determine the potential supple-\nments needed to support the rigors of training and recovery.\n## \u25cf\nSupplements supported via evidence, such as caffeine, creatine, beta-alanine,\nnitrates, and essential amino acids, may be used to support the training demands\nand recovery for combat sport athletes.

The average fight camp phase ranges from 8 to 10 weeks, depending on the\ncompetition schedule. During this time, combat athletes are preparing for the demands\nof an upcoming match. Training regimens are characterized by moderate to intense\nexercise which usually includes strength training, technical sparring, multi-disciplinary\nskill acquisition, and recovery modalities.\n5.2.1.Longitudinal weight descent\nThe types of weight-loss methods that are utilized prior to competition across all combat\nsports include: fasting, low energy intake, gradual dieting, restricting fluid intake, increas-\ning sweat response such as heated wrestling, plastic suits, saunas, and heat exposure.\nOther practices commonly include taking diet pills, enemas, laxatives, and engaging in\nbulimia [99]. While these tactics are adopted at times, they are not endorsed by the ISSN,\nand the authors of this position stand. Furthermore, self-reported data show that gradual\ndieting and increased energy expenditure due to greater training frequencies are com-\nmon in all combat sports. However, the weight-loss practices are not identical between\ncombat sports, with the most common practices shared between boxing and MMA [99].\nA primary physiological objective of fight camp is to decrease body fat. Such decreases\ncan be advantageous for combat athletes as it may foster a greater strength-to-mass ratio,\nimprove the endurance needed for mastering skill applications, and lead to a more\neffective longitudinal weight descent. Moreover, lean body mass holds more water\ncompared to adipose tissue [100]. Therefore, maintaining or increasing lean body mass\nmay aid in successful water manipulation and effective acute water loss strategies 24\u2013\n48 h prior to weigh-in. Some combat athletes gradually reduce weight during the general\npreparation phase, which may be warranted if they are above the targeted 12\u201315% walk-\naround weight threshold. In this regard, athletes have started their weight descent as high\nas 18% above their required scale weight and successfully arrived at the weight for their\ndivision in 8 weeks as shown in Figure 1. However, this magnitude of weight descent was\nclosely supervised by the nutrition professionals of the UFC Performance Institute and\nmay not be advised for most athletes.\nAn area of emerging research involves investigating the effects of specific diets on\nathlete performance. The high fat diet in endurance athletes may induce metabolic\nadaptations [101,102], but it has been debated whether these changes improve perfor-\nmance [103]. In contrast, high carbohydrate diets are shown to increase short-term\nperformance and recovery when performing repeated high-intensity activities and recov-\nery, which is the underlying nature of combat sports [49,104,105]. Higher protein intake\nduring the longitudinal weight descent promotes the preservation of lean body mass\nduring caloric deficits [106]. Although protein is a vital macronutrient, higher protein\n## 18A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nintake should not compromise appropriate intake of carbohydrates and/or fat intake.\nGood sources of protein are lean meats such as skinless chicken, steak, eggs, fish, lentils,\nbeans, and isolated or concentrated protein powders [43]. Ready-to-drink protein shakes\nand powders may have utility during fight camp for use between training sessions, since\ncombat athletes often have several sessions a day.\nCombat athletes are commonly recommended to aim for weight loss of 0.5\u20131 kg of\nbody mass each week with the resulting energy deficit being based largely on total daily\nenergy needs [38,107]. This rate of decline and the concomitant magnitude of energy\ndeficit is contingent upon the length of the camp and how much body mass must be lost.\nAccordingly, the sports nutrition professional can calculate a rate of weekly weight loss\nbased on the duration of the fight camp and the total loss in body mass that is required;\nthen plan a systematic longitudinal weight descent.\nIt is advisable that the sports nutrition professional carefully monitor changes in body\nmass and body composition as it is common for combat athletes to lose weight too swiftly\nif they are not meeting their energy requirements during fight camp. This may lead to\ndecrements in skill training, endurance, recovery, motivation, and losses in lean tis-\nsue [38].\nAs discussed, the Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham equation coupled with the levels of\nphysical activity can be used to calculate energy needs during the longitudinal weight\ndescent phase of fight camp. Although undesirable, if the athlete starts fight camp >15%\nabove their desired weight class or if training camp is of shorter duration, such as <8\nFigure 1. Example of a real-world successful weight descent over an 8-week camp [3].

However, due to\nthe intense training demands during fight camp, carbohydrate intake should not drop\nbelow 3\u20134 g/kg/d [86,98,108]. A protein intake of 1.2\u20132.2 g/kg/d is advised to preserve\nlean tissue and aid in recovery during the energy deficit [54,106]. To facilitate an energy\ndeficit needed for a 0.5\u20131 kg loss of body mass per week, fat intake is often manipulated\nto elicit a greater energy deficit, resulting in fat intake levels that can range from 0.7 to 1.3\ng/kg/d. However, this range may need to be further adjusted to couple with TDEE. As the\ncombat athlete\u2019s body mass descends, subtle adjustments in energy intake may be\nwarranted and most often a decline in energy is commensurate with the loss in body\nmass and/or changes in RMR that occur. Moreover, this strategy must still support the\ntotal training volume, which may include skills training and conditioning.\n5.2.2.Tapering\nTapering for MMA competition often involves a strategic reduction in training load while\nintegrating heat acclimation, sweat sessions, and nutritional manipulation to prepare for\nfight week and competition. The taper period typically begins 1\u20132 weeks before fight\nweek and may involve a reduction in training volume by approximately 40%.\nIncorporating high-intensity, fight-specific drills, helps maintain neuromuscular adapta-\ntions at an intensity sufficient to prevent detraining effects and maintain technical acuity\n[109,110]. Additionally, increasing heat acclimation sessions, such as using a sauna or hot\nbath, can enhance sweat rates, improve heat tolerance, and aid in weight management\nduring tapering period [111]. These sessions, combined with additional sweat suit or\nplastic-wrapped cardio sessions, may be employed to compensate for the decreased\ntraining volume [37].\nNutritional strategies during the taper should involve a methodical decrease in calories\nand hydration to align with the reduced training load and manipulating macronutrients\nto prepare for fight week. A gradual reduction in carbohydrate intake can promote\nglycogen depletion and assist in weight reduction due to the water loss associated with\nglycogen stores [112]. Simultaneously, protein intake should be maintained to preserve\nmuscle mass, while fat intake can be adjusted to meet caloric goals while attempting to\nmaintain performance output [107,113]. Combining nutritional adjustments with both\nrapid weight loss and acute water loss strategies allows for effective weight management\nand readiness for fight week [37]. This tapering period and the strategies discussed will\nenable combat athletes to optimize their preparation for fight week and maximize their\nperformance on fight day [22,112].\n5.2.3.Fight camp \u2013 nutrient timing\nCombat athletes may engage in up to three training sessions per day during fight camp.\nAs mentioned previously, training sessions may be brief (i.e. 45 minutes), or can be\nextended sessions (i.e. 90 to 120 min) of various intensities and metabolic demands\n[98]. Thus, planning meal frequency around the athlete\u2019s training schedule aids in meet-\ning carbohydrate and protein needs for the day. The ISSN\u2019s Position Stand on Nutrient\nTiming details such strategies, and relevant points are summarized here. It is recom-\nmended athletes consume a meal two to 3 h prior to their first training session [97].\nStrategies for acute fueling prior to training session (e.g. 60 minutes) include consuming\nhigh glycemic, carbohydrates (1\u20134 g/kg) while limiting fat and fiber intake to minimizing\n## 20A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\ngastrointestinal distress during exercise. During high-intensity exercise, especially in hot\nconditions, athletes should consume a carbohydrate solution (6\u20138% concentration) to\nmaintain blood glucose levels and hydration. Following a training session, consuming\na combination of carbohydrates (\u22651.2 g/kg/h) and protein (0.2\u20130.5 g/kg/h) post-training\nsession enhances glycogen repletion and supports muscle recovery. Due to the multiple\ntraining sessions scheduled during fight camp, rapid refueling strategies may be adopted\nfor sessions less than 6 h apart. The ISSN recommends a carbohydrate intake of 0.6 to\n1.0 g/kg of body mass within the first 30 min after exercise, followed by carbohydrate\nintake every 2 h for the next 4 to 6 h to promote maximal glycogen replenishment. As\nmentioned previously, adding protein to carbohydrate intake enhances glycogen\nresynthesis. During fight camp, athletes focus on performance and longitudinal weight\nloss. This emphasizes the need for a well-planned diet that aligns with training sche-\ndules and fight weight goals.\n5.2.4.Hydration\nProper hydration is imperative for the health and performance of athletes. Even a small\nchange of 2.5% in body weight due to dehydration can impair performance [114].\nAdequate hydration should aid in supporting metabolic and training demands, reducing\nthe risk of injury, and promoting recovery. The primary determinant of maintenance water\nrequirement appears to be metabolic. However, total fluid requirements are highly\nvariable and quite complex. Therefore, it is challenging to set a daily water requirement\nfor combat athletes. Nevertheless, 1.5 ml/kcal may be suitable to cover variations in\nactivity level, sweating, and solute load [115].\nIt is recommended that combat athletes focus on consuming sodium and potassium-\nbased fluids to avoid electrolyte imbalances [98,116]. In situations where there is excessive\nwater loss due to individual sweat rates or hot, high humidity environments, athletes may\nneed to consume more water. For quick and complete rehydration, a simple approxima-\ntion of 1.5 L of fluid per kg weight loss is recommended [111]. Fluid loss and intake must\nbe closely monitored during a fight camp to gauge sweat rates. A good strategy to\nmanage fluid balance is to take measurements of the athlete\u2019s body weights preceding\nand following training sessions [48]. This may aid the sports nutrition professional in\nensuring proper fluid replenishment and provides essential information regarding acute\nwater loss and sweat rates that can inform weight-making tactics during fight week.\nDuring fight camp, heat acclimation activities can be beneficial for combat athletes.\nThe primary goal of heat acclimation is to increase the amount of sweat produced by\nsweat glands, thus increasing overall whole-body sweat rate [117]. Heat acclimation is\ninduced by cumulative exposure to heat stress which in turn leads to physiological\nadaptations including an increase in plasma volume, increased sweat rate, increased\ncutaneous vasodilation and more efficient sweating over the body\u2019s surface [118]. With\nhabitual activation (e.g. heat acclimation), sweat glands demonstrate plasticity in their\nsize and neural/hormonal sensitivity, which in turn impact sweat rates and sweat [Na\n## +\n## ]\n[117]. It is of notable importance to consider that sweat rates vary amongst individuals.\nGenerally, individuals who are heat acclimated will start to sweat earlier and will have\na higher sweat rate while exercising/training. Additionally, it is commonly understood\nthat athletes with a larger body mass and BMI will sweat more readily compared to\nindividuals with a smaller body mass. Nevertheless, two individuals with a comparable\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION21\n\nbody mass and similar exposure to heat acclimation may have differing sweat rates due to\ngenetic distinctions, surface area-to-mass ratio, aerobic capacity, exercise intensity, and\nenvironmental conditions [119]. It should also be noted that there are seasonal adapta-\ntions in sweat rates from winter to summer, and athletes consistently living and training\ncloser to the equatorial latitudes, particularly with high humidity, may have increased\nwhole-body sweat rates and water loss [120]. Hence, monitoring sweat rates during fight\ncamp can provide valuable insight into combat sport athletes\u2019 daily fluid losses from\ntraining and/or heat acclimation activities.\nBecause of the limited published literature on heat acclimation and sweat rates in\ncombat sports, the authors propose the following protocol which has been derived from\nmethods currently adopted by combat athletes. Heat acclimation protocols can be\nplanned during the fight camp and throughout longitudinal weight descent. Protocols\nshould begin 4\u20135 weeks prior to the acute water loss phase during fight week. With\nrespect to the proper modalities, athletes can use the sauna 3\u20134 times weekly for\n15\u201325 min or hot water immersion for 20 min 2\u20133 times per week. Acclimation starting\npoints and frequency of sessions will vary based on the athlete\u2019s weight, body composi-\ntion, typical fluid turnover during training, and training environment (temperature and\nhumidity).\n5.2.5.Longitudinal weight descent - practical applications\n## \u25cf\nWithout modalities that measure RMR, utilize the Mifflin St Jeor or Cunningham\nequations to determine daily energy requirements.\n## \u25cf\nAim for 0.5\u20131 kg in body mass loss per week.

Many of the combat disciplines wear minimal protective equipment\nand thus injuries are inevitable. Common injuries occur to skeletal muscle, bone, tendon,\nand ligament. Injuries normally occur to the head, specifically in the head, wrist/hand and\nknees and shoulders. The most frequent injury types are lacerations, fractures, and\nconcussions [3]. Although injuries frequently occur during a competition, injuries outside\nof a match are also commonplace. Overtraining and overuse injuries, stemming from the\n## 22A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\ndemanding training schedules can also occur and contribute to the increased risk profiles\nof combat athletes\u2019 [121,122].\nThough several nutrition strategies exist to address injury prevention and recovery,\na hierarchy is commonly followed. Inadequate dietary intake can increase the risk of\ninjury, impair performance, and contribute to an overproduction of stress hormones [123].\nConsequently, the top priority that should be addressed is ensuring energy balance is\nmaintained as outlined in the General Preparation section. When the energy intake is\ninsufficient, the body will start to further break down lean mass to use as energy [124].\nThough protein intake plays a crucial role in protein turnover and lean mass maintenance,\nit is important to keep in mind that when energy intake is insufficient, protein may be\nrequired to contribute to energy demands [124]. Due to protein\u2019s role in tissue repair and\nlean mass maintenance, protein requirements will therefore be even greater during injury.\nIntakes as high as 2.3 g/kg/day can minimize muscle loss during energy deficits in active\nindividuals [47,125]. In critical care patients, intakes ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 g/kg/day\nsupport recovery and healing [126]. Based on the literature, the authors recommend\n1.3\u20132.5 g/kg/day of protein to promote healing and maintain lean body mass during\ninjury recovery. Distributing protein intake throughout the day may make it more man-\nageable for athletes to meet their protein intake goals. It is also critical to be aware of the\nmicronutrient needs during the period of injury. Micronutrients are necessary to support\ntissue repair and recovery. For example, vitamin D positively affects the immune system\nand combats inflammation in muscles and bones [48]. Vitamin C and zinc are important\nfor the immune system and are frequently used in wound healing [48]. Other dietary\nsupplements can also be considered for their potential effects in promoting recovery (e.g.\ncreatine monohydrate, fish oils, curcumin, probiotics, and amino acids [Table 3]).\n5.3.1.Nutrition for traumatic brain injury\nAs with other impact sports, the prevalence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in combat\nsports is high, particularly during fight camp when sparring and live drills are often\nemphasized. The causes of TBI in combat sports vary from direct impact or hits to the\nhead, knockouts, or takedowns involving blunt force to the head [127]. TBIs range in\nseverity and are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Many fighters have experienced\nsome form of TBI during their careers [127,128]. Thus, nutrition strategies implemented\nfollowing TBI may aid in their recovery and timely return to sport [129,130].\nFollowing a TBI, nutritional considerations are aimed at supporting repair and\nrecovery, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, neurogenesis, and restoring\nfunction [131]. As with general injury nutritional management, adequate protein\nand energy are paramount. Research suggests that increasing protein and energy\nintake in the hours following a TBI improves neurological outcomes and lowers\nmortality rates [132,133]. During TBI recovery, energy needs are estimated to\nincrease between 100% and 200% of baseline resting energy expenditure values\n[134]. Equations to predict resting energy expenditure (Mifflin St-Jeor of\nCunningham) or indirect calorimeters should be used to estimate baseline resting\nenergy expenditure. Protein intake of approximately 2 g/kg/d total protein further\nsupports recovery from TBI [135]. Supplementation can also aid the recovery\nprocess as well as help combat athletes consume the therapeutic doses of essen-\ntial nutrients. Research suggests that creatine may have neuroprotective effects\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION23\n\n[136] by minimizing inflammation and preserving brain tissue [136]. Studies in\nadolescents reported improvements in cognitive function and reduced headaches,\ndizziness, and fatigue with creatine supplementation following mild TBI [137].\nOther supplements including omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidant supplements, and\nB-vitamins also support brain function and are shown to reduce the severity of\nbrain injuries [129,130]. Omega-3 fatty acids, commonly found in fish oil supple-\nments, have anti-inflammatory properties, and may help reduce neuroinflammation\n[131]. Antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, B vitamins and vitamin E are\nthought to mitigate oxidative damage following TBI [138]. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is\na precursor to glutathione, and glutathione offers neuroprotective effects from\noxidative damage stemming from brain injuries [139]. Although such clinical nutri-\ntional therapies do not cure TBIs, there is compelling evidence supporting nutrition\nbeing beneficial in promoting recovery from brain injuries. Furthermore, inade-\nquate nutritional intake impairs the recovery process.\n5.4Fight week/rapid weight-loss strategies\nWeight cutting is a process that includes weight loss (RWL) to qualify for a desired weight\nclass division, followed by rapid weight gain (RWG) to recover body mass losses before the\nTable 3.

A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nstart of the competition [36]. When official weigh-in occurs on the day before in MMA,\napproximately 24\u201336 h remain prior to the beginning of competition. This duration is\nthought to be an adequate amount of time for athletes to rehydrate and refuel sufficiently\nand safely [140].\nWeight can be lost rapidly through, water loading, fluid restriction, acute dehydration,\nhot water immersion/salt baths and sauna, fasting, and reduced carbohydrate and fiber\nintakes [141,142]. Barley et al. provided insights into the weight cutting strategies across\ncombat sports disciplines. Six hundred thirty-seven athletes from judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,\nboxing, MMA, and Muay Thai/kickboxing were surveyed online. Results showed that 87%\nof combat athletes included food restriction (skipping meals, reducing overall energy\nintake to <22 kcal/kg), 83% used water loading (hyperhydration), 79% restricted fluids\n(hypohydration), 51% used sauna, 85% increased training, and 43% used sweat suits and\nplastics [138,143]. Additionally, some combat athletes may use potentially harmful meth-\nods, such as diuretics and laxatives to lose excessive body weight as they aim to compete\nin the lowest possible weight class [99]. Such practices have a detrimental effect on\nhealth, well-being, mood, and performance [107,144].\nThere have been studies that have reported weight cutting practices to have no\nnegative effect on exercise performance [37,145]. However, there remains a limited\nbody of scientific research investigating rapid weight-loss strategies, which includes\nevaluations of the different methods, the influence on competitive performance, acute\nphysiological changes, and refueling and recovery methods to improve performance\nfollowing rapid weight loss [99]. The existing literature on the current practices for several\nrapid weight-loss strategies is discussed in this section.\n5.4.1.Glycogen depletion\nDietary carbohydrates are stored in skeletal muscle (350\u2013700 g) and liver tissue (80\u2013100 g)\nas glycogen and act as readily available energy reserves for glucose metabolism with final\nconcentrations being dependent upon training status, diet, muscle fiber-type composi-\ntion, sex, and body mass [146]. Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose that binds to\nwater at a ratio of 1 g glycogen to 2.7 g water [147]. Glycogen can contribute as much as\n1\u20132% of skeletal muscle mass and up to 8% of liver mass [112,148]. In consideration of\nthis, previous research has shown that 7 days of a low carbohydrate diet, combined with\ntraining and a slight reduction in energy intake (<10%), can achieve a body mass reduc-\ntion of 2% while maintaining strength/power measured via a 30-s Wingate test [149].\nA similar body mass loss was achieved following a 14-day period of carbohydrate restric-\ntion. Thus, due to the known association of water content with endogenous glycogen\ncontent, glycogen depletion continues to be a common means for combat athletes to\nreduce body mass.\nA low carbohydrate diet can aid in glycogen depletion. Although combat athletes\nneed carbohydrates for performance, adhering to <50 g carbohydrates/day during the\nrapid weight-loss phase prevents glycogen replenishment. The need for carbohydrates\nto drive high-intensity work, and its connection to body mass via glycogen status\ncreate an ongoing conflict for the combat athlete. The extent to which glycogen levels\ncan be manipulated is primarily influenced by carbohydrate intake and the existing\nglycogen status before implementing glycogen-depleting strategies [150]. The rate/\namount of glycogen depletion is in part predicated on the athlete\u2019s typical\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION25\n\ncarbohydrate intake, which should be calculated in grams and calories. In addition, the\ndegree to which one can/should manipulate glycogen status is limited by the recovery\nwindow (i.e. time from official weigh-in to competition) of different combat sport\ndisciplines and the regulations of the promotion. Care should be taken to evaluate\nthe cost/benefit of additional exercise in the period just prior to weigh-ins versus\na longer period of carbohydrate restriction prior to competition [151]. Ultimately,\nexercise intensity, duration, and carbohydrate feeding will dictate the rate of glycogen\ndepletion. During fight week, training sessions typically include technique work, drills,\nand additional aerobic exercise, often under the auspices of the skill coach. Many skills\ncoaches have combat athletes continue technique work and drills during fight week,\nwhich may result in greater skeletal muscle glycogen depletion due to the high-\nintensity nature of the activity. If the athlete is restricting dietary carbohydrates and\ncontinues high-intensity skills training, glycogen stores can be significantly depleted\nwithin hours.\nTherefore, training intensity and frequencies, carbohydrate intake, and body weight\nshould be carefully monitored to ensure an effective weight cut. Accordingly, because\ntotal calories, carbohydrates, and water may be restricted, if additional activity is needed\nfor glycogen depletion and rapid weight loss, low-intensity steady state (LISS) cardio may\nhave utility during fight week [151]. To achieve this, an exercise intensity ranging between\n40% and 50% of maximum heart rate for 30\u201345 min should be suitable as an additional\nmethod for rapid weight loss. Consequently, the sports nutrition professional must work\nin concert with the fight week strategies of the skills coach and monitor training frequen-\ncies and intensity, exercise protocols, and losses in body mass, to perform glycogen\ndepletion safely and effectively.\n5.4.1.1.Glycogen depletion practical \u2013 applications.\n## \u25cf\nBefore glycogen depletion is initiated, the sports nutrition professional should\ncalculate the combat sport athlete\u2019s average daily carbohydrate intake.\n## \u25cf\nGlycogen depletion can begin as early as seven days prior to weigh-in.

Indeed, such tactics can be used to facilitate the removal of\n## 26A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nintestinal contents and promote acute water loss [152]. While these methods may be\neffective for expelling the colon of intestinal bulk, the use of clinical bowel preparation\nformulas (e.g. osmotic laxatives and purgatives) has been shown to reduce exercise\ncapacity and ultimately overall performance and therefore it is not recommended\n[153]. Instead, dietary strategies to reduce total food volume may therefore be\na preferable way to manipulate the mass of intestinal contents while maintaining\nperformance [152].\nDietary fiber can slow the transit time of food through the bowel and draw water into the\nintestinal space, thereby adding bulk to stools [152]. Different foods possess different fecal\nbulking properties [154], and ultimately the changes in habitual fiber intake, particularly\nnon-fermentable fibers, can elicit changes in body mass. Estimated fermentability has been\nshown to determine the role of fiber in total fecal wet weight. Less fermentable dietary\nfibers from cereals, such as wheat bran, contribute the most to total fecal weight compared\nto more fermentable dietary fibers, such as those originating from fruits [154]. This addi-\ntional fecal matter is likely due to non-fermentable fiber\u2019s higher water-binding capacity, as\nwell as its greater resistance to fermentation from colonic bacteria. There appears to be\na linear relationship between fiber intake and bowel cleanliness in pre-colonoscopy patients\n[155], and the utilization of a low-fiber diet for 2 days prior to treatment reduced bowel\ncleanliness compared to high-fiber diets [155]. Indeed, when a low-fiber diet (<10 g/d) was\ncontinued for 7 days, it was as effective as a bowel preparation formula [156]. In a study of\n19 healthy males consuming a habitual high-fiber diet of 30 g fiber/day for 7 days followed\nby four of a low-fiber diet (<10 g fiber/d) that was matched for energy and macronutrients,\na significant reduction in body mass was shown after 4 days of a low-fiber diet (\u0394 = 0.4 \u00b1\n0.91% p < 0.05) and on day 5 (\u0394 = 0.74 \u00b1 0.99% p < 0.01). Subjects did report increased\nhunger and a decline in stool frequency; however, the diet modification was reported to\nbe tolerated and repeatable [157].\nDespite limited research on the bowel-emptying effects of a low-fiber diet, the use of\nlow fiber diet appears to be a useful tool for reducing body mass without the need for\nbowel preparation formulas, which can ultimately pose a risk of undue physiological\nstress on the gastrointestinal system [156]. Additionally, following a low-fiber diet for\na minimum of 3 days seems to be effective for rapid weight loss with minimal disruption,\ndespite moderate increases in appetite, reductions in bowel movements, and hardening\nof stools. Considerations should be made to identify habitual dietary fiber intake and fiber\ntype to better estimate and proactively account for changes in body mass when following\na low-fiber diet. Furthermore, since females and older populations have reported slower\nGI motility, further research needs to be conducted to understand the interplay between\ngender and age in the effects of low fiber on body mass changes [158]. Further research is\nneeded to establish precise guidelines for the use of low-fiber diet due to the large\nvariations in whole gut transit times, which can range from 10 to 96 h [159]. Continued\nresearch on the implications of low-fiber diets in weight-making sports, as well as health\nand performance outcomes, is warranted.\n5.4.2.1Fiber manipulation practical \u2013 applications.\n## \u25cf\nLow-fiber diet may be used as a tool to aid RWL in weight class sports.\n## \u25cf\nReducing dietary fiber from habitual intake (>30 g/d) to a Low fiber diet (<10 g/d) for\n4 days may result in 1\u20132% decrease in body mass.\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION27\n\n## \u25cf\nNon-fermentable fibers from cereals, wheat bran, and vegetables contribute to fecal\nwet mass more than fermentable fibers found in fruits.\n## \u25cf\nConsiderations should be made for female and older athlete populations who may\nexperience slower GI motility and bowel clearance times.\n5.4.3.Sodium manipulation\nAs combat athletes lose water and electrolytes through thermoregulatory sweating\nduring heat exposure, aerobic activity, and skills training during fight week, it is well\nestablished that the rate and composition of sweat can vary significantly within and\nbetween individuals [160]. Scientists and practitioners may conduct sweat tests to deter-\nmine sweat and electrolyte losses, particularly sodium. However, the current methodolo-\ngical practices and challenging field conditions often lead to inconsistent and inaccurate\nresults. While techniques like whole body washdown, which is the reference standard,\nrequire a laboratory, more practical methods such as sweat patches have shown incon-\nsistency and limited effectiveness [160].\nAccordingly, determining how much sodium to ingest or restrict during fight week\nproposes numerous challenges. To establish a measure of sodium restriction, it is advi-\nsable that the sports nutrition professional first ascertain a baseline of sodium intake\nduring fight camp and then propose a lower sodium intake of < 2.3 g daily during fight\nweek, if needed. Due to increases in sweat loss, athletes should not consume less than the\ncurrent RDA of 2300 mg/day in order to minimize sodium losses [161,162]. Thus, for\nathletes whose base intake is below 2300 mg, more emphasis can be put on other\nwater manipulation modalities. Physiologically, the human body tightly regulates the\nosmotic pressure of body fluids through renal excretion and retention of electrolytes and\nfluids. A summary of literature examining the relationship between sodium intake and\nwater intake found that in a steady state, urine volume remains unchanged over a broad\nrange of sodium intakes. Rather, the adaptation to higher sodium excretion lies only in\nchanges in urinary sodium concentration [163].\nWater retention is responsible for the well-documented increase in body mass follow-\ning acute increases in sodium intake [163]. The resulting increase in fluid intake due to\nthirst in conjunction with no significant changes in urine volume causes the extra fluid to\nremain in the body to limit the rise in plasma sodium concentration by diluting the\nsodium that cannot be excreted quicky enough [163]. In a steady state, if sodium levels\nremain within a reasonable range of (50\u2013250 mmol/day), most of the observed adaptation\nwill rest on changes in the concentration of sodium in the urine without any changes in\nurine flow rate. However, when an abrupt change in sodium occurs (e.g. 70 mmol/d to\n250 mmol/d), assuming usual daily activities remain constant and without any limitations\nin water intake, a return to sodium and body mass balance requires 2\u20133 days [164].\nThe complexity of sodium steady state dynamics and its relationship to body mass\nchanges is further complicated by the varying tactics utilized by combat athletes such as\nhyperhydration (water loading), heat acclimation, caloric restriction, diuretics, etc., during\nthe weight-cutting period [116,143,165,166]. Despite the limited body of research on\nvarying sodium levels and their effects on acute water loss, sodium restriction has become\na common practice among some combat athletes during the weight cutting period [98].\nDue to the limitations in previous research aimed at investigating the role of sodium\n## 28A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nrestriction on acute water loss in combat athletes, the precise degree to which sodium\nneeds to be reduced is unknown. Further research is warranted.\n5.4.3.1Sodium restriction \u2013 practical applications.\n## \u25cf\nSodium restriction should be based on athlete\u2019s usual intake and anticipated/needed\nwater loss.\n## \u25cf\nSodium restriction recommendations may vary greatly, and there is a paucity of\nresearch associated with restriction and acute water loss. A low sodium diet of < 2.3\ngrams of sodium during fight week may be suitable.\n## \u25cf\nLess than 2.3 grams of sodium per day is deemed low for the general population,\nindividuals with significantly lower rates of sweat loss and sodium loss than combat\nathletes, hence caution should be taken in dropping levels significantly below 2.3\ngrams.\n## \u25cf\nMonitoring both weight and fluid loss in relation to sodium restriction will determine\nif sodium restriction is suitable or if additional restrictions are needed.\n5.4.4.Polyuria/water manipulation\nUrine excretion is tightly regulated by the renal system. Fluid balance is achieved by\naldosterone and anti-diuretic hormone triggering a renal response to either release or\nconserve fluid thereby maintaining total body water as well as electrolyte balance [167].\nUrine excretion is the body\u2019s primary fluid balance regulator and as such, typical urine\nlosses range from 1\u20132 liters per day [168,169]. Urine volume decreases with dehydration,\nwith the obligatory rate of urine production to excrete metabolic waste being 0.5 liters\nper day [167,170]. The upper limit for urine production is 1.8 liters per day; therefore, fluid\nintake that exceeds urine production limits may lead to hyponatremia [171].\nTo encourage polyuria and thus acute water loss, the use of pharmacological diuretics\nto promote greater urine loss has been reported among combat athletes [166]. In a survey\nof 637 combat athletes, the prevalence of reported diuretic use was 12% overall, with the\nlowest reported use in judo of 5% and highest of 12% in Tae Kwando [143]. The survey did\nnot specify the type of diuretic used which may include pharmaceutical grade diuretics\nand/or over-the-counter products such as caffeine anhydrous. The lower prevalence of\ndiuretic use may in part be due to the increase in testing and regulatory bodies that\nmonitor athletes given that pharmacological diuretics are included in the World Anti-\nDoping Agency\u2019s List of Prohibited Substances [172].\nA commonly adopted method for inducing polyuria amongst combat athletes is water\nloading or hyperhydration. Previously, water-loading practices in combat sports had been\nlargely based on anecdotal evidence. Athletes and sports nutrition professionals pre-\nscribed varied recommendations for total fluid consumption and the durations in which\nwater loading should be applied. To date, there is not a robust body of research on the\nsubject. Water loading is a strategy characterized by the consumption of large volumes of\nfluids for several days prior to fluid restriction. A rapid weight-loss questionnaire of\n314 mmA athletes showed that the frequency of water loading occurred \u201calways\u201d or\n\u201csometimes\u201d in 72.9% of the athletes surveyed [173]. Barley et al. examined acute water\nloss habits in 637 combat athletes and revealed a water-loading prevalence of over 60% in\nMMA, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing, with an overall prevalence of 53% among all\ncombat sports [143].\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION29\n\nA study which provided significant insight on the efficacy and safety of water loading\nwas conducted by Reid et al. [109]. They investigated the effect of water loading for 3 days\n(100 ml/kg/d) compared to a control group (40 ml/kg/d), followed by fluid restriction\non day 4 (15 ml/kg/d). Significant body mass loss was observed in the water-loading\ngroup on day 5, with a loss of 3.2% compared to 2.4% in the control (CON) group [116].\nThe difference in body mass loss in the water-loading group was attributed to greater\nfluid loss relative to fluid intake during the period of fluid restriction, compared to the\ncontrol group. Despite concerns regarding hyponatremia, the study showed no evidence\nof problematic blood chemistry changes or impaired physical performance following\nrehydration. Moreover, a 3.2% loss in body mass represents nearly half of the 6.7%\nabove scale weight at 72 h prior to weigh-ins.\nAnother study conducted by Cho & Han [174] included 13 university wrestlers (weight\n71.5 \u00b1 8.0 kg, BMI 25.0 \u00b1 2.0 kg/m\n## 2\n) randomly divided into the weight loss (WL) group (n =\n6) and water-loading weight loss (WWL) group (n = 7). Wrestlers performed a two-week\nweight-loss program, targeting an average of 5\u201310% of body weight reduction, under the\nsupervision of a coach. Participants were instructed to drink 1.5\u20132 liters and 6\u20137 liters in\nthe weight loss and water loading weight loss groups, respectively, for two weeks prior to\nweigh-in. Neither group consumed water the day before weigh-ins. Anthropometric\ncharacteristics, hematocrit (HCT), serum electrolytes, aldosterone, and cortisol were mea-\nsured before and after weight loss. Results showed the weight-loss and water-loading\nweight-loss groups showed a decrease in body mass of 8.2% and 11%, respectively. These\nnumbers supersede the 2.4% and 3.2% loss in body mass observed by Reid et al. [109].\nHowever, it must be considered that the wrestlers underwent approximately eleven\nadditional days of water loading, caloric deficits, and intense training. Hence, the total\nloss in body mass of 8.2% and 11% also includes changes in body composition. Of notable\nimportance, there were no negative implications on blood chemistry and the researchers\nconcluded that large-volume hydration before water restriction for short-term loss in\nbody mass can be completed safely under the parameters with which this study was\nconducted.\n5.4.5.Acute water loss\nThe manipulation of body mass via sweating is the most common method of rapid weight\nloss undertaken by combat athletes [152]. Although sweat losses are commonly used,\nthere are currently no generalized standards to determine the ideal method, the optimal\nduration of exposure, and the most suitable environmental factors. However, acute water\nloss strategies must be applied while minimizing overheating and adverse performance\nand health outcomes.\nDespite previous research suggesting that combat athletes lose nearly 10% of their\ntotal body mass pre-weigh-in [107,141,165,166,175,176], solely utilizing sweat loss to\nachieve a 10% decline in body mass within 24 h of weigh-in is ill-advised and potentially\ndangerous to health. With several factors notwithstanding, body mass losses ranging from\n5% to 8% can have varying degrees of impact on health and performance. Some data\nindicate that certain athletes can achieve this decline in body mass via acute water loss\nand not compromise performance and health [166]. Nevertheless, to date, this remains\ninconclusive.\n## 30A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nA major challenge is understanding which acute water loss methods should be\nutilized to achieve the decrease in body mass leading to weigh-ins; and what is the\ntrue starting point to initiate acute water loss tactics. The starting point prior to acute\nwater loss should represent body mass in a euhydrated and well-nourished state (i.e.\nprior to glycogen and fiber depletion) to take advantage of non-essential compartments\nof bound water.\nIn a research study that captured weight loss data in 600+ successful UFC\nathletes\u2019 weight cuts, it was shown that there was a significant reduction in non-\nessential body mass in the 24\u201372 h window prior to weigh-ins. UFC fighters were\napproximately 6.7% above their weight class 72 h before weigh-ins, but were only\n4.4% over their weight classes 24 h prior to weigh-ins [177]. Although the hydra-\ntion status in the 24-h window before weigh-ins was not published, a 4.4% body\nmass loss represents a much smaller and therefore feasible amount of acute water\nloss.\nIt has been noted that when women and men were matched for surface area-to-\nmass ratio and fitness level, both had similar heart rate and core temperature\nresponses to heat acclimation. Despite this, sweating responses were greater in\nmen, and they required a shorter heat acclimation period (4\u20135 days) compared to\nwomen [118]. With the growing number of female participants in combat sports, it is\nimportant to consider key differences in sweat rate and heat tolerance. Female\nthermoregulatory responses vary throughout the menstrual cycle due to the influ-\nences of reproductive hormones estradiol and progesterone. During the luteal phase\nor high hormone phase of oral contraceptive use, thermoregulatory control of both\nsweating and cutaneous vasodilation is shifted by approximately 0.5 Celsius to\nhigher core body temperatures [118]. In hot and dry conditions, males experience\na smaller change in core temperature compared to women, whereas the opposite is\ntrue in hot and humid climates. Men have a higher overall sweating capacity, which\nallows them to respond more efficiently to dry heat [118]. It is worth noting that\nwomen have a lower sweat capacity than men for a given amount of metabolic heat\ngeneration, and they are also less responsive to the effects of training adaptation on\nsweat rate and sweat temperature threshold [118]. Women between 18 and 35 years\nof age are also five times more likely to experience symptoms associated with\northostatic intolerance compared to men of the same age and health status [118].\nDespite these differences in sweat rate and adaptations, the role of sex hormones in\nthermoregulation and acute water loss (adaptive whole-body heat loss) is complex,\nand further research is needed.\nThe prevalence of sweat loss strategies for acute water loss is not surprising consider-\ning the relatively large body mass losses that can be achieved in a rapid and time-efficient\nmanner, with sweat rates up to two liters per hour having been recorded [168]. The onset\nof sweating can be altered by changes in plasma electrolyte concentration, plasma\nvolume, and total body water content. However, these factors are not optimized to\nenhance sweat losses without the introduction of more fluid into the body, which is\ncontrary to the end goal of acute water loss [152].\nVariables that may dictate the rates and volume of acute water loss includes:\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION31\n\n## \u25cf\nEnvironment: increased ambient heat increases core temperature and increases the\nneed for sweat to be produced to dissipate heat [178]\n## \u25cf\nThe athlete\u2019s heat acclimation preparation\n## \u25cf\nClothing: insulating clothing traps heat thereby increasing core temperature and\nsweat rate and dark colors can increase the amount of radiant heat an athlete is\nexposed [178].\n## \u25cf\nDuration and intensity of physical activity: higher exercise intensity (higher percen-\ntage of VO\n## 2\nMax) requires increased energy and therefore respiration which in turn\ngenerates more heat. The increased heat production leads to an increased sweat rate\nto compensate and cool the body [178].\n## \u25cf\nIndividual physiology: body\u2019s surface area, heat acclimation and genetic/sex differ-\nences can cause variations in sweat rate [178]\n## \u25cf\nThe athlete\u2019s acute water loss strategy preferences and psychological state\nGenerally, acute water loss strategies can be classified into two categories: active\nsweating (exercise or skill training often with the aid of a sauna suit or layered clothing\nfor insulation) or passive sweating (exposure to hot environment, e.g. sauna, steam\nrooms, infra-red saunas, wraps and/or hot baths). It is important to note the differ-\nences in physiological response to active versus passive sweating. Cutaneous vasodila-\ntion and sweating during heat stress results in a redistribution of blood flow to the\nperiphery and a requirement for increased cardiac output to meet the thermoregula-\ntory demand. Passive sweating prior to active sweating decreases plasma volume,\nsweat rate, and body heat storage [179]. These physiological changes occur to a lesser\nextent when hypohydration develops only during exercise [179]. When combat ath-\nletes are in a very depleted and hypo-hydrated state, they may need to limit active\nsweat loss methods. During exercise, the mismatch between venous return and limited\ncardiac output is mitigated by the muscle pump which propels blood back to the\nheart. The lack of muscle pump or sudden cessation of exercise in addition to\nincreased peripheral venous compliance can result in a transient decrease in cerebral\nperfusion pressure causing orthostatic intolerance, dizziness, fatigue, and syn-\ncope [118].\nTraditionally, many combat athletes make use of combining training sessions (active)\nwith fluid restriction to promote dehydration. Active sessions are often used with addi-\ntional passive methods for acute water loss. Tangible arguments for, and against, active\nstrategies can be made. Active strategies such as high-intensity skills training, shadow\nboxing and striking pads require increased energy expenditure and oxygen demand\nwhich in turn generates more heat, leading to an increase in sweat rate to compensate\nand cool the body. This can result in the athlete accumulating considerable acute water\nlosses. Additionally, many skills coaches practice active methods, such as striking and\ntechnical sparring, with the notion that this maintains the motor skill applications which\nwere advanced during the general preparation and fight camp periods. Moreover, the\nincreased loss of peripheral skeletal muscle glycogen associated with active methods such\nas hitting pads and striking, may further contribute to water loss. If the combat athlete has\ngreater than the average of 4.4% body mass to lose within 24 h of the official weigh-in,\nboth active and passive strategies may be warranted in some situations. Nonetheless, as\ndiscussed, reduced plasma volumes from acute water loss can alter changes in cardiac\n## 32A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\noutput, flow, distribution, and blood pressure, which in turn can impair the efficiency and\nsafety of active methods such as skills training and technical sparring [118].\nIt is of notable importance that many coaches, fighters and teams have established\nmethods for acute water loss and the sports nutrition professional may have to operate\nwithin the preferred parameters of these strategies. As an example, if the team uses active\nmethods and several skill application sessions as part of acute water loss methods, then\npassive strategies should be used only when required and when ample time is available\nfor recovery. As with all nutritional strategies in combat sports, particularly as it pertains to\nacute water loss requirements, the sports nutrition professional is often required to\nevaluate what is optimal and what is necessary.\nPassive strategies may allow the combat athlete to spare muscle glycogen and reduce\nthe elevated physiological demands which active strategies may induce on both the\nnervous systems and skeletal muscles. The frequency and duration of passive strategies\nwill be contingent on how much body mass must be reduced within 24 h of weigh-in.\nPassive strategies, as with all acute water loss methods, may be appropriate when\nsufficient post-weigh-in recovery time is available. Nevertheless, passive strategies must\nbe strategically applied to optimize the volume and rate of acute water loss [166]. It is also\nprudent that the sports nutrition professional ensures that combat athletes do not over-\nheat from passive strategies for acute water loss. Monitoring the athletes core tempera-\nture is a method to avoid overheating, heat stress injuries or potential hyperthermia. The\ncore temperature in which such conditions may occur is not exact and highly variable\nbetween individuals. However, hyperthermia is defined as a body temperature greater\nthan 40\u00b0 Celsius (104\u00b0 Fahrenheit) [180]. Therefore, independent of the cumulative\nexposure to heat acclimation the combat athlete has undertaken, it is imperative to\navoid heating near this core temperature. As with all acute water loss strategies, the\npros and cons are contingent upon any contraindications, the coexisting practices, and\nthe demands of the combat athlete.\n5.4.6.Passive weight cut strategies\nIn general, passive weight cut strategies refer to those modalities in which combat\nathletes undergo exposure to heat for acute water loss. These strategies are most often\ndone without extensive physical activity.\n5.4.6.1.Hot baths.Hot water immersion is a common, passive method, used by\ncombat athletes to induce acute water loss. A survey of rapid weight-loss practices\nby MMA athletes indicated that 76% of fighters report using hot baths either \u201calways\u201d\nor \u201csometimes\u201d [141]. Hot water immersion has also been coupled with the addition of\nvarious salts, often Epsom salts, to further enhance acute water loss. Connor and Egan\n[181] investigated the magnitude of body mass losses during hot water immersion\nwith or without the addition of salt, with the temperature commencing at 37.8\u00b0C and\nbeing self-adjusted by participants to their maximum tolerable temperature. In\na crossover design, eight male MMA athletes (29.4 \u00b1 5.3 y; 1.83 \u00b1 0.05 m; 85.0 \u00b1 4.9\nkg) performed a 20-min whole-body immersion (39.0\u201339.5\u00b0C) followed by a 40-min full\nbody wrap in a warm room (24.0\u201329.0\u00b0C), twice in sequence per visit. The full body\nwrap included a knitted wool hat, cotton t-shirt, hooded cotton sweatshirt, cotton\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION33\n\ntracksuit bottoms/sweatpants, and socks. Participants were then covered in blankets\non a bed in an adjacent bedroom with only their faces exposed.\nAdditionally, the athletes restricted carbohydrates, fiber, and fluids as commonly\npracticed during fight week. Body mass losses induced by just the hot bath protocols\nwere 1.71 \u00b1 0.70 kg and 1.66 \u00b1 0.78 kg, for the freshwater bath and saltwater bath, respec-\ntively. Hence, demonstrating no further loss from saltwater baths [181]. The total loss in\nbody mass from hot water immersion was equivalent to 2.0% of body mass. Additional\nlosses were shown from 40-min wraps in a warm room. The combined protocols of hot\nwater immersion and full-body wraps produced a 4.5 \u00b1 0.7% decrease in body mass. In\nconclusion, hot water immersion can be an effective passive technique for acute water\nloss with added salt, creating no further losses of body mass.\n5.4.6.2.Hot water immersion \u2013 practical applications.\n## \u25cf\nHot water immersion is an effective method that can be applied within 24 h of\nweigh-making activities (i.e. weigh-ins) with its effectiveness being contingent\nupon the loss in body mass required and whether other rapid weight loss and\nacute water loss modalities are being applied.\n## \u25cf\nWater temperature typically ranges from 39\u201340\u00b0C (102\u2013104\u00b0F) or potentially higher if\ntolerated by the athlete for durations ranging from 15\u201320 minutes.\n## \u25cf\nAmbient room temperature, air current and humidity levels are often controlled.\n## \u25cf\nThough Epsom salt is sometimes added to baths, recent studies have shown no\nincrease in loss of body mass from their addition.\n## \u25cf\nCarefully monitor the athlete\u2019s core temperature during hot water immersion to\nprevent hyperthermia (~40\u00b0C, ~104\u00b0F).\n5.4.6.3.Dry saunas.There is a paucity of data which has directly investigated the effects\nof dry sauna exposure on rapid weight loss in combat athletes. Brito et al. surveyed 580\ncombat athletes participating in grappling (judo, jujitsu) and striking (karate and Tae\nkwon do) combat sports in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. They found 50% of athletes\nuse saunas as a method of rapid weight loss [182]. Challenges remain with studies that\nhave attempted to quantify either absolute water loss and/or water loss expressed as\na percentage of initial body weight, in both women and men.\nNumerous factors can play a role in the amount of water loss due to sauna exposure\nsuch as body mass, body surface area, body composition, biological sex, hydration status,\nphysical activity level, frequency of sauna use, acute hormonal influence (e.g. vasopressin,\naldosterone, etc.) ambient temperature and humidity of the sauna, and the length of time\nin the sauna. Additionally, some research measures water loss due to saunas using\na traditional scale, while other research uses bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).\nThese differences in methodology may make comparisons between different studies\ndifficult to interpret. Podstawski et al. [183], examined the effect of dry sauna on acute\nweight loss in men using calibrated body mass scales. The participants were repeatedly\nexposed to short sauna baths [4 \u00d7 10 min; 5-min breaks between sauna sessions;\ntemperature of ~ 90\u00b0C (~194\u00b0F) at 14\u201316% relative humidity] [183]. This specific sauna\nprotocol led to a significant loss of 0.65 kg of body mass through sweat loss [183].\nAnother study measured acute water loss in 674 young men and women (19\u201320 y)\nexposed to two different 10-min dry sauna sessions [~90\u00b0C (~194\u00b0F) at 35% relative\n## 34A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nhumidity, separated by 5 min (which included 30 s of cooling in 10\u00b0C water)]. The\ninvestigators reported decreases in body mass measures via a calibrated scale between\n0.25 and 0.7 kg and 0.32\u20130.82 kg in women and men, respectively [184]. Interestingly, as\na percentage of overall body mass lost via sweating, both females and males lost\nbetween ~0.5\u20130.9% of their initial body mass [184]. It should be noted that the more\noverweight or obese the participants were, the greater amount of water loss was\nobserved [184]. Conversely, the least amount of water loss was recorded in the under-\nweight subjects in both sexes [184]. Similar water losses when expressed as a percent of\nbody mass lost (~0.9%), following a sauna bath, have also been reported in earlier\nresearch [185].\n5.4.6.4.Dry sauna \u2013 practical applications.\n## \u25cf\nDry saunas utilize a heating element to heat ambient air which in turn raises body\ntemperature via conduction and convection of heated air in addition to radiation\nfrom the heated surfaces in the sauna room.\n## \u25cf\nDry sauna temperatures can range from 60\u201390 \u00b0C (140\u2013192\u00b0F).\n## \u25cf\nDue to the significantly higher ambient temperature, care must be taken to minimize\nthe chances of overheating while utilizing the sauna. Cooling strategies such as icing\nof the head, neck and palms can be implemented.\n## \u25cf\nDuration of dry sauna heat exposure is highly individualized with exposures lasting\nfrom as little as 5 minutes to as long as 20 minutes.\n## \u25cf\nResearch shows average fluid losses of 0.27\u20130.68 kg and 0.32\u20130.82 kg in women and\nmen, respectively, which is equivalent to 0.5\u20130.9% loss in body mass.\n## \u25cf\nNumerous factors will affect sweat rates during fight week, including body mass,\nbody surface area, body composition, biological sex, hydration status, physical\nactivity level, frequency of sauna use, acute hormonal influence (e.g. vasopressin,\naldosterone, etc.) ambient temperature and humidity of the sauna, and the length of\ntime in the sauna.\n## \u25cf\nSports nutrition professionals must be prudent when deciding if dry sauna should be\npart of an acute water loss protocol and the duration and temperature of exposure\nwhich is needed.\n## \u25cf\nCarefully monitor the athletes core temperature during any type of sauna use to\nprevent hyperthermia 40\u00b0C and 104\u00b0F.\n5.4.6.5.Steam rooms.Research identifying precise rates of acute sweat loss that can be\nachieved through exposure to wet saunas or steam rooms is also scant. Pilch et al.\n## 186\ninvestigated the differences in acute weight loss and subjective feelings of thermal\ncomfort between wet sauna (~59\u00b0C/138\u00b0F and 60.5% humidity) and a dry sauna (~91\u00b0C/\n196\u00b0F and 18% humidity) in young (22-24y) females. The sauna protocol (for both wet and\ndry sauna) consisted of three separate 15-min intervals separated by 5-min rest/cooling\nintervals. Overall, the average weight loss was significantly greater in the dry sauna (~0.37\nkg) compared to the wet sauna (~0.25 kg). Additionally, rectal temperature, heart rate,\nand subjective feelings of thermal discomfort were greater in the wet sauna [186]. The\nsame pattern of acute weight loss (dry sauna vs. wet sauna was 0.72 kg and 0.36 kg,\nrespectively) were also shown in men subjected to the same basic study design (three\nseparate 15-min intervals separated by 5-min rest/cooling intervals) using calibrated\nscales [187]. The research suggests that dry sauna may be a more effective and\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION35\n\ncomfortable protocol for combat athletes during acute water loss sessions [186]. Some of\nthe reasons include:\n## \u25cf\nSteam rooms utilize steam from evaporating water to heat ambient air.\n## \u25cf\nSteam rooms can have humidity levels at 95\u2013100% and typically have lower ambient\ntemperatures (50 \u00b0C, 122 \u00b0F)\n## \u25cf\nTo prevent scalding, steam rooms often operate for short intervals making the man-\nagement of ambient temperature and humidity challenging during acute water loss.\n## \u25cf\nTracking sweat rate can also be challenging due to the high humidity and condensa-\ntion of water on the skin\u2019s surface. When sweating does occur, due to the high\nhumidity level the body\u2019s natural evaporative cooling mechanisms are rendered\nineffective, increasing the risk of overheating.\n## \u25cf\nDry sauna in the limited literature demonstrates higher sweat rates than steam and\nmay be a more effective and comfortable option.\n## \u25cf\nDue to these challenges, steam rooms should be avoided, if possible, for acute water\nloss in favor of more controllable modalities.\n## \u25cf\nCarefully monitor the athletes core temperature during any type of steam room use\nto prevent hyperthermia 40\u00b0C and 104\u00b0F.\n5.4.6.6.Infrared saunas/portable saunas/sauna blankets.As with the dry sauna and\nsteam room methods, there is limited study on the efficacy of infrared saunas.\nConventional saunas use heating elements to raise air temperatures within the units.\nInfrared saunas use infrared light to heat your body while the air temperature remains\nrelatively unchanged. Accordingly, a combat athlete\u2019s core temperature can rise without\nhaving to sit in a room with ambient temperatures close to 200\u00b0F. Logically, this may be\na viable option for combat sport athletes. Infrared saunas, portable saunas, and sauna\nblankets utilize infrared radiation to heat the body\u2019s surface.\n## \u25cf\nTemperature ranges vary by model. In some models, temperatures can range from\n35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) on the lowest setting to 70 \u00b0C (160 \u00b0F) on the highest setting.\n## \u25cf\nPortable saunas and sauna blankets allow the athlete\u2019s head to be exposed to\nambient air thereby presenting greater opportunities for sweat rate tracking and\nimplementing cooling strategies such as icing.\n## \u25cf\nPortable saunas/sauna blankets are easy to transport and have great utility, hence\ntheir rapid adoption as an acute water loss modality.\n## \u25cf\nCarefully monitor the athlete\u2019s core temperature during any type of sauna use to\nprevent hyperthermia 40\u00b0C and 104\u00b0F.\n5.4.6.7.Mummy/burrito.Mummy wraps are a commonly utilized modality that entails\nwrapping an athlete (apart from the head) in warm towels or a combination of thermal\nmylar blankets with towels. Some combat athletes may or may not choose this approach.\nMummy wraps are often used in unison with other acute water loss techniques. Scientific\nresearchers have yet to thoroughly investigate this strategy and its efficacy, particularly as\nan isolated strategy. Nevertheless, the aforementioned study by Conor and Eagan [181]\nused wraps after two sequences of 20 min of hot water immersion. The athletes wrapped\nin heavy clothing and blankets in a room (24\u201329 C) for 40 min after 20 min of hot water\nimmersion. The process of wrapping post hot water immersion did lead to additional\n## 36A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\nlosses in body mass of 2.79 kg more than hot water immersion alone. Combined, 20 min\nof hot water immersion and 40 min of wrap for a total of 60 min were performed and then\nrepeated. The athletes lost a total of 4.5 \u00b1 0.7% of total body mass. Therefore, this\ncombination may be an effective approach for acute water loss ranging from 14 to 16 h\nbefore weigh-in. Despite the efficiency of this technique, sports nutrition professionals\nshould proceed with care and attempt to cool the athletes when needed. Additionally, it is\nrecommended to monitor an athlete\u2019s body temperature and water loss and use this\npractice with the minimum applications and durations needed to achieve the desired loss\nin body mass.\n5.4.7.8.Mummy wraps \u2013 practical applications.\n## \u25cf\nThough rarely used alone, the combination of other AWL modalities, such as training,\nhot baths, sauna, etc., prior to mummying allows the insulated heat to be main-\ntained, thus extending the duration of sweating while minimizing heat stress.\n## \u25cf\nDuration of mummying is highly variable but due to the reduced heat stress\ncompared to modalities such as a hot bath/sauna, longer durations of 15\u201330 min\nare common.\n## \u25cf\nCarefully monitor the athletes core temperature during any combination of hot\nbaths, sauna, and mummying to prevent hyperthermia, 40\u00b0C and 104\u00b0F.\n5.4.6.9.Floating.Respiratory water loss is water that is expelled via pulmonary ventila-\ntion. Respiratory water is a byproduct of aerobic metabolism. Even in the absence of\nvisible perspiration, approximately one-half of water turnover occurs through what is\ncalled insensible water loss, i.e. water lost from the lungs and skin [115]. Numerous factors\ncan influence the amount of respiratory water losses. For instance, in temperate environ-\nments, these losses are approximately equal to the amount of water generated through\naerobic metabolism: roughly 250\u2013350 ml per day, increasing with respiratory rate as\nexercise intensity increases [168]. Large decreases in humidity (e.g. 80% to 20%) can\nsignificantly affect respiratory water losses, particularly during exercise where losses\nincrease from 0.8 to 2.7 mL/min [169]. However, it appears that altitude doese not\nsignificantly alter respiratory water losses [188]. Oral exhalation compared to nasal\nexhalation also increases net respiratory water losses by up to 46% [189]. In practice,\nthe ability to acutely manipulate this small amount of water relative to other forms of\nwater manipulation strategies is minimal. Nonetheless, insensible water loss from respira-\ntory water losses is often factored into acute water loss strategies and commonly coined\nthe term \u201cfloating.\u201d Increasing a combat athlete\u2019s exposure to low humidity environments\nin the days leading to weigh-ins or particularly during sleep may provide an increase in\nwater loss [152]. While the capacity for water loss through respiration is limited, particu-\nlarly when floating at nighttime, combat athletes often require fluid losses in terms of\nounces in the latest stages of acute water loss practices to successfully arrive at the\nrequired weight to compete.\n5.4.7.Fight week weigh-in protocols\nThe allotted recovery window between weigh-ins and competition dictates the magni-\ntude of acute water loss. As noted, several combat sports disciplines require same-day\nweigh-ins with limited recovery windows. Olympic sports such as wrestling and Tae kwon\ndo are such examples, as well as most of the governing bodies regulating jiu-jitsu\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION37\n\ncompetitions. Accordingly, rapid weight-loss strategies have diminished value to the\nathlete when the window of time available to replenish fluid and electrolyte losses is\nless than 4 h. Moreover, sports such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu and wrestling may have an athlete\non the mat well within 2 h of their official weigh-in, depending on their weight class and\nhow the competition is structured. As such, recovery windows that are short make it\nharder for meaningful rehydration and refueling to occur if excessive weight cuts are\nadopted. Therefore, careful planning to maintain an appropriate weight during the\ngeneral preparation phases becomes of greater significance. Moreover, the longitudinal\nweight descent must be carefully designed to allow the athlete to decrease as much body\nmass as possible via changes in body composition and reductions in body fat. It is\nimperative to have the proper planning of total calories and macronutrient distributions\ncoupled with training volumes. Based upon anecdotal observations from the authors\nworking with thousands of combat athletes, below are recommended percentages of\nbody mass loss that may be most appropriate for varying lengths of time between weigh-\nin and competition.\n5.4.7.1.Weigh-in timing.\n5.4.7.1.1.Weigh-in < 4 h of competition.\n## \u25cf\nNet 0\u20133% body mass loss from sweat losses starting in a euhydrated state.\n## \u25cf\nNutritional Status: Glycogen stores should not be fully depleted prior to sweat loss,\nallowing for an additional 1\u20132% body mass loss from water bound in glycogen.\n## \u25cf\nRelevant Sports: Brazilian Jiu jitsu, wrestling, and most amateur combat sports\nweigh-ins.\n5.4.7.1.2.Weigh-in within 4\u201312 h of competition.\n## \u25cf\nNet 2\u20134% body mass loss from sweat losses starting in a euhydrated state.\n## \u25cf\nNutritional Status: Glycogen stores should not be fully depleted prior to sweat losses,\nallowing for an additional 1\u20132% body mass loss from bound water in glycogen.\n## \u25cf\nRelevant Sports: Combat sports with a morning weigh-in and an afternoon/evening\ncompetition (e.g. Amateur Muay Thai, Olympic Boxing),\n5.4.7.1.3.Weigh-in within 12\u201324 h of competition.\n## \u25cf\nNet 3\u20135% body mass loss from sweat losses starting in a euhydrated state.\n## \u25cf\nNutritional Status: Glycogen stores may be depleted prior to sweat losses given the\nadequate recovery window for glycogen restoration.\n## \u25cf\nRelevant Sports: Morning or evening weigh-in with competition the following day.\n5.4.7.1.4.Weigh-in within 24\u201336 h of competition.\n## \u25cf\nNet 4\u20136% body mass loss from sweat losses starting in a euhydrated states.\n## \u25cf\nNutritional Status: Glycogen stores may be depleted prior to sweat losses given the\nadequate recovery window for glycogen restoration.\n## \u25cf\nRelevant Sports: Professional MMA (UFC) or professional Muay Thai, Kickboxing, or\n## Boxing.\n## 38A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\n6.Weigh-In Recovery\nPrior to competition, combat athletes have their body mass verified by an official \u201cweigh-\nin\u201d to ensure that they meet the weight requirements for the competitive division. As\nnoted, the time span between official weigh-ins varies among different combat sports,\nathletic commissions, promotions, and competition levels with recovery windows span-\nning 15 min up to 36 h. Considering this, combat athletes utilize an array of rapid weight\nloss and acute water loss strategies to manipulate their body mass, allowing them to\ncompete in a lower weight class in hopes of attaining a physical size advantage [6]. When\nrapid weight loss and acute water loss strategies are conducted appropriately, sustain-\nably, and safely, the physiological consequences and performance/health impairment can\nbe reversed or mitigated by adopting effective post weigh-in nutrition and hydration\nrecovery tactics. Key considerations for post weigh-in recovery include rehydration,\nglycogen restoration and gastrointestinal distress management [6].\n6.1.Post weigh-in \u2013 rehydration\nOlympic combat athletes commonly lose ~5% of their body mass in the week prior to\nweigh-ins [107], with professional MMA athletes in the UFC losing approximately 4.4% of\ntheir body mass 24 h before weigh-ins [177]. To reverse the physiological consequences of\ndehydration [190,191], a post weigh-in rehydration plan must consider the amount of\nweight lost from dehydration (i.e. sweat losses). General sports nutrition recommenda-\ntions suggest replacing 125\u2013150% of the fluid lost from sweat [192]. However, replacing\nsuch a large volume of fluid is attainable for recovery periods of 24\u201336 h, but it is often\nimpractical for smaller recovery periods such as same-day weigh-ins.\nTo facilitate fluid assimilation, ingested fluids must first be consumed and emptied into\nthe stomach, absorbed through the small intestines, and then enter the bloodstream.\nSeveral factors can influence gastric emptying, including energy density, volume of fluid\nbolus, fluid ingestion rate, osmolality, and pH [193]. Although gastric emptying rates can\nvary from person to person, they generally level off around 600 ml, with larger volumes\n(>1,000 ml) resulting in slower emptying [194]. Another important consideration is the\nreduced gastric emptying rate that occurs after intense exercise [195], hypohydration\nexceeding 3% of body mass [149], and the common practice of reducing food and fluid\nintake before weigh-ins. Taking these factors into account, for combat athletes under-\ngoing acute weight loss from hypohydration greater than 3% of body mass, it is recom-\nmended to start with a conservative initial bolus of approximately 300\u2013500 mL of fluid\nimmediately after the official weigh-ins, followed by additional volumes (~240\u2013350 mL) at\nregular intervals (every 30 min) to maintain gastric volume.\nPost weigh-in rehydration should meet the electrolyte replacement needs of combat\nathletes. Electrolytes lost through thermoregulatory sweat losses are primarily sodium\nand chloride [192]; thus, replacing these key electrolytes allows for the optimal restoration\nof osmolality and fluid volume. Estimating total sodium losses from sweat can be challen-\nging due to the large variations amongst individuals, however this typically ranges\naround ~20\u201380 mmol/dL [196]. This can be further complicated by the common practice\namong combat athletes of adopting a lower sodium diet prior to weigh-ins [6]. Despite\nthis, sodium content correlates with fluid retention. Therefore, oral rehydration solutions\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION39\n\n(ORS) with a sodium range of 50\u201390 mmol/dL [192] should be utilized when hypohydra-\ntion is >3% of body mass. For hypohydration <3% of body mass, commercial sports drinks\n(<30 mmol/dL sodium) result in adequate water retention. Rehydration can also be\nmonitored in part by tracking urination rate and color as well as measuring the athlete\u2019s\nweight as the rehydration protocol progresses.\n6.1.1.Post weigh-in carbohydrate\nCarbohydrates are critical for the high-intensity nature of combat sports. Due to the\npractice of glycogen depletion prior to weigh-in to facilitate rapid weight loss, glycogen\nrestoration following weigh-ins is desired [6]. Post weigh-in nutrition should include\nadequate carbohydrate content to at least fuel the athlete for the competition and\nmaximize glycogen stores. Glycogen restoration must be carefully balanced and intro-\nduced at a tolerable rate to reduce gut discomfort while being at a low enough energy\ndensity to not hamper gastric emptying during the initial rehydration phase [194]. For this\nreason, an oral rehydration solution with a 2\u20133% carbohydrate (e.g. 15 g/500 ml) solution\nis more appropriate during rehydration for hypohydration >3% of body mass, whereas\nsports drinks with a ~ 5% carbohydrate (e.g. 25 g/500 ml) solution is well tolerated for\nhypohydration <3% of body mass.\nWith the initial oral rehydration solution and then solid foods, post weigh-in carbohy-\ndrate intake totaling 8\u201312 g/kg is appropriate for combat athletes that underwent sig-\nnificant glycogen depletion to facilitate rapid weight loss prior to weigh-ins. This range of\ncarbohydrate ingestion is suitable for maximizing liver and skeletal muscle stores.\nHowever, if greater glycogen depletion has not occurred then aggressive carbohydrate\nintake is not necessary, and combat athletes may simply adopt a more moderate post\nweigh-in carbohydrate intake ranging 4\u20137 g/kg [6].\nStrategies to meet carbohydrate needs post weigh-in include high glycemic index\ncarbohydrates [197] and the use of carbohydrate rich fluids to simultaneously meet total\nfluid needs while facilitating glycogen restoration [6]. When ingesting carbohydrates at\na rate of >60 g/h, incorporating food/fluids/supplements with a varied carbohydrate\nsource (e.g. glucose and fructose) facilitates carbohydrate absorption via multiple gut\ntransport mechanisms [198].\n6.1.2.Post weigh-in gastrointestinal distress management\nPost weigh-in intake should prioritize optimizing nutritional status while avoiding GI\ndistress. Of the many dietary modifications used to elicit rapid weight loss, a low residue\ndiet has the most benign impact on performance and health [157]. In addition, fiber has\na minimal contribution to energy needs and reduces gastric emptying/absorption rates\nand therefore the rapid reintroduction of fiber can cause discomfort [199] Fiber intake\npost weigh-in contraindicated for optimal post weigh-in recovery and should be limited.\nProtein and fat intake should be managed in the post weigh-in protocols as large boluses\nmay also delay gastric emptying.\nIn addition, gastrointestinal distress following weigh-ins can be limited by avoiding\ntrigger food/beverages during the acute rehydration phase (0\u20132 h following weigh-ins).\nCurrently, no literature on specific foods that cause GI distress in combat athletes exists.\nHowever, certain foods are associated with gastrointestinal distress in both the general\n## 40A. A. RICCI ET AL.\n\npopulation and athletes [200,201]. Thus, the authors suggest avoiding or minimizing\nthese foods:\n## \u25cf\nCoffee (independent of caffeine intake) relaxes lower esophageal sphincter.\n## \u25cf\nCitrus Fruits and Juices: lemon/lime, grapefruit and pineapple have high acid\ncontent.\n## \u25cf\nTomatoes: tomato juice, tomato-based pasta sauces have high acid content.\n## \u25cf\nCarbonated Beverages: gaseous distention of the stomach and increases pressure on\nthe lower esophageal sphincter causing reflux and bloating.\n## \u25cf\nChocolate: contains compounds which relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter\n## \u25cf\nPeppermint, Garlic, Onion: relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter.\n## \u25cf\nFatty, Spicy, Fried Food: delay gastric emptying and may exacerbate reflux symp-\ntoms, bloating and indigestion.\n7.Fight day strategies\nFight day-specific nutrition strategies are targeted for athletes with a 24\u201336-h recovery\nwindow, as shorter recovery windows (<12 hr) are simply an extension of the weigh-in\nrecovery/fueling strategies discussed earlier. In theory, athletes with 24+ hour recovery\nwindow adopt most (if not all) rapid weight loss and acute water loss strategies, including\ncarbohydrate depletion, sodium reduction, and low residue diets in addition to sweat\nlosses. At the same time, the long recovery window presents sufficient time for rehydra-\ntion and refueling for peak performance. Fight day specific strategies can be summarized\nas providing athletes the refueling needs in a form, dosage and ingestion rate that\nminimizes gut disturbances yet meets and/or respects an athlete\u2019s habits, traditions,\nand performance needs.\nFight day macronutrient intake should consist primarily of carbohydrates, as high-\nintensity sports (>70% VO2max) rely extensity upon carbohydrate as a fuel source [97].\nDue to the range in competition times and variation in individual athlete sleep/recovery\nneeds, a simple yet effective calculation for estimating fight day carbohydrate needs is\n1\u20134 g/kg of body mass [97]. Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index and easily diges-\ntible starchy carbohydrates that an athlete habitually ingested throughout the prepara-\ntion cycle are recommended. This may include (but not limited to): starchy tubers\n(potatoes/sweet potato), rice and flour-based products (sourdough/pancakes/pastas).\nAnxiety associated delays in-gastric emptying 2\u20133 h prior to competition may limit meal\nbolus tolerance [202]. Strategies to meet carbohydrate needs can include liquid sources of\ncarbohydrates, e.g. sports drinks at 6\u20138% carbohydrate in addition to low volume carbo-\nhydrate snacks (bars, pretzels, applesauce, dates, etc.).\n(a)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 08:00 for a fight time of 14:00 has 6 h to\nemploy fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 6-h window, this athlete should ingest\nbetween 210-280 g of carbohydrates.\n(b)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 10:00 for a fight time of 22:00 has 12 h\nto employ fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 12-h window, this athlete should\ningest between 420-560 g of carbohydrates.\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION41\n\nProtein intake can promote glycogen repletion, minimize muscle damage and promote\na positive nitrogen balance [97]. In addition, protein co-ingested with carbohydrates\nbefore a training session/competition can promote glycogen repletion and prevent\nreactive or rebound hypoglycemia [203]. As for a dosing strategy, a modest intake pre-\ncompetition split into 20\u201330 g meal servings will meet protein needs without displacing\ncarbohydrate intake [97].\n(a)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 08:00 for a fight time of 14:00 has 6 h to\nemploy fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 6-h window, this athlete should ingest\nbetween 50-70 g of protein in 20-30 g/meal boluses.\n(b)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 10:00 for a fight time of 22:00 has 12 h\nto employ fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 12-h window, this athlete should\ningest between 100-140 g of protein in 20-30 g/meal boluses.\nAlthough calorically dense, fats are less of a priority due to the high-intensity nature of\ncombat sports. Rather than adding high fat sources to meals (e.g. cream sauces) or\ningesting fat-rich snacks (e.g. tree nuts), the fat calories should simply be a byproduct\nof the food source itself (e.g. eggs). It should also be noted that due to reduced gastric\nemptying effect of fats [204] compounded by pre-fight stress and anxiety [205], fat intake\nshould be avoided 3 h prior to competition.\nRespecting athlete traditions and habits is of equal importance to performance nutri-\ntion and gut tolerance-based fight day strategies. The sport nutrition professional should\nmaintain cultural competence when recommending fight day dietary strategies especially\nfor athletes of diverse cultures in a way that is effective and appropriate. Fight day dietary\nstrategies should consist of food and beverage options that are familiar and habitually\nconsumed through the athlete\u2019s competition preparation. In addition, rigid and uncom-\npromising fight day dietary strategy may fail to accommodate for the chaotic nature of\ncombat sports fight day logistics which may have frequent interruptions due to increased\nsleep/recovery needs, preference for fight day \u201cshakeouts\u201d or training sessions, changes\nto bout times/fight card logistics and unaccounted for anxiety-induced food intolerance.\nA flexible approach utilizing an array of food and beverage sources that are easily\navailable, familiar and performance nutrition oriented is the best approach for meeting\nan athlete\u2019s fight day nutrition needs.\n7.1.Refueling and rehydration \u2013 practical applications\nThe following practical applications are based on rehydration strategies used in clinical\nsettings and current practices used by combat athletes [116,150,166].\nAcute Rehydration (1\u20132 h post weigh-in)\n## \u25cf\nUtilize oral rehydration solution (1 to 1.5 liters per hour)\n## \u25cf\nUtilize fast-acting carbohydrates with low osmolarity at a tolerable rate of \u226460 grams\nper hour.\n## \u25cf\nRe-introduce easily digestible starchy carbohydrates as tolerated (i.e. saltines, bagels,\nrice cracker, etc.)\n## 42A.

RICCI ET AL.\n\nNon-acute Rehydration (3\u20136 h post weigh-ins)\n## \u25cf\nFluid must contain electrolytes: primarily sodium, potentially also potassium and\nchloride.\n## \u25cf\nUtilize simple and easily digestible starchy carbohydrates as tolerated (i.e. white rice,\npotatoes, sweet potatoes, pasta, etc.)\nMuscle Glycogen Restoration Phase (6+ hours Post Weigh-in)\n## \u25cf\nPrioritize carbohydrate intake, ingesting only low to moderate protein.\n## \u25cf\nAvoid high-fat foods, as these will delay gastric emptying. Eat small frequent meals,\nrather than a single large bolus.\n## Weight Regain\n## \u25cf\nAs the combat athlete refuels and rehydrates, monitor urination, urine color, and\nincreases in body mass.\n## \u25cf\nAt least a 10% increase in body mass post weigh-in may be optimal for fight\nperformance and reducing health consequences.\n8.Final summary and conclusions\nCombat sports encompass a range of tactics and skills that involve direct one-on-one\nphysical contact with the ultimate objective of overpowering, striking, or submitting\none\u2019s opponent. These disciplines attract athletes at various levels, ranging from\nrecreational and amateur competitions to professional and Olympic events. One\ndistinguishing feature of combat sports is the implementation of weight divisions,\nwhich serve to categorize athletes based on their body mass. This ensures that\ncompetitors face opponents who are of comparable size and weight, promoting fair-\nness and safety in the sport. To compete in their desired weight class and potentially\ngain a competitive edge, athletes resort to weight-loss practices that can be both\nsustained/longitudinal and rapid. Accordingly, it is crucial to consider the nutritional\nand weight cut strategies of training and competition in combat sports since they can\nsignificantly impact an athlete\u2019s performance and overall well-being. Distinct phases of\ntraining, such as the general preparation/off camp, fight camp, and fight week, all\nrequire specific strategies to optimize performance and support the athlete\u2019s health.\nWhen designing nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat athletes, factors such\nas body mass, body composition, type of combat sport, duration of the fight camp,\nand the time between weigh-in and the actual fight must be considered.\nThe following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society. The Research\nCommittee of the Society has approved them:\n(1)Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and\ncompetition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies\nfor training and competition.\n## JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION43\n\n(2)As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 minutes, contribution of the\naerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic\nglycolytic pathways support high-output bursts.\n(3)During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain\na weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement.\n(4)Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-\nmethylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or\nrecovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition.\n(5)During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an\nefficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined\nusing indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or\n## Cunningham.\n(6)Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean\nbody mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands.\nMacronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0\u20134.0 g/kg,\nprotein 1.2\u20132.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day.\n(7)Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at\n24 h, prior to weigh-in.\n(8)Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute\nwater loss.\n(9)During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exer-\ncise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1 to 2% loss in body mass, with\nequivalent losses from a low fiber intake, <10 g/day for 4 days.\n(10)During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immer-\nsion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision\n(optimally ~2\u20134% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in).\n(11)Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/\nmass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage.\n(12)Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-\n90 mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in.\n(13)Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of \u2264 60 grams/h should follow oral\nrehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid\ngastrointestinal distress.\n(14)Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8\u201312 g/kg may be appropriate for combat\nathletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight\nweek. 4-7 g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction.\n(15)Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain \u226510% of body\nmass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss.\n(16)The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are\nunknown, necessitating further research.\n## Acknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Tyler Minton, MS.

Although they are widely consumed by athletes, evidence-based analysis is required to\nsupport training outcomes or competitive performance in specific disciplines. Combat sports have a\npredominant use of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, reaching peak exertion or sustained\neffort for very short periods of time. In this context, the use of certain NEAs could help athletes to\nimprove their performance in those specific combat skills (i.e., the number of attacks, throws and\nhits; jump height; and grip strength, among others) as well as in general physical aspects (time to\nexhaustion [TTE], power, fatigue perception, heart rate, use of anaerobic metabolism, etc.).  Med-\nline/PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO were searched from their inception to May 2022 for randomised\ncontrolled trials (RCTs). Out of 677 articles found, 55 met the predefined inclusion criteria. Among\nall the studied NEAs, caffeine (5\u201310 mg/kg) showed strong evidence for its use in combat sports to\nenhance the use of glycolytic pathways for energy production during high-intensity actions due to\na greater production of and tolerance to blood lactate levels. In this regard, abilities including the\nnumber of attacks, reaction time, handgrip strength, power and TTE, among others, were improved.\nBuffering supplements such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate and beta-alanine may have a\npromising role in high and intermittent exertion during combat, but more studies are needed in\ngrappling combat sports to confirm their efficacy during sustained isometric exertion. Other NEAs,\nincluding creatine, beetroot juice or glycerol, need further investigation to strengthen the evidence\nfor performance enhancement in combat sports.  Caffeine is the only NEA that has shown strong\nevidence for performance enhancement in combat sports.\nKeywords:combat sports; ergogenic aid; performance; sport supplement\n## 1. Introduction\nThe different disciplines of combat sports have as common elements the involvement\nof explosive and high-intensity movements of both the upper and lower limbs. They are\nexecuted in rounds or bouts of a short duration (seconds to minutes), the objective of which\nwill be conditioned by the specific combat sport and its rules [1]. Performance in combat\nsports is determined by the acquisition of a physical and physiological profile appropriate\nto the characteristics of each discipline [2]. The requirements of combat sports involve a\ngreat technical record and a high number of repetitions at high intensity, which are inter-\nspersed with moments of low intensity. The energetic demands of these sports show a high\ninvolvement of aerobic metabolism. However, high-intensity actions require the involve-\nment of anaerobic metabolism (the ability to produce energy by intramuscular adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine and/or anaerobic glycolysis during short duration\nexercise) [1], represented by elevated blood lactate levels after competition [2].\nNutrients2022,14, 2588. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14132588https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\n\nNutrients2022,14, 25882 of 32\nThe magnitudes of strength involved differ among combat sports. On the one hand,\nthose with predominantly punching movements, such as punches and kicks, have a greater\nneed for explosive strength and power; on the other hand, those with grappling actions\nmay require a greater emphasis on isometric and concentric muscle strength.  Likewise,\nthere are also differences according to the limbs that mainly develop the motor actions: in\nsports such as boxing or judo, the upper limbs are mostly used; in taekwondo it is centred\non the lower limbs, while in karate both upper and lower limbs are used. In each of these\nsports, specific equipment and clothing are used that, according to scientific literature,\ncould condition the technical aspects and even the physical demands of the athletes [2].\nDepending on these characteristics, which are based, among others, on the rules of the\nsport, combat sports can be categorised into two main groups: grappling and striking. In\naddition, a third group involves both grappling and striking, namely mixed martial arts\n## (MMA) [2].\nWithin the combat sports with grappling, there are sports in which gripping, throw-\ning, ground combat, chokeholds and joint locks are allowed. These sports include judo,\nwrestling and jiu-jitsu [3,4]. Punching or striking sports include those in which the hands\n(such as boxing), the legs (such as taekwondo) or both the hands and legs (such as karate)\nare used [2]. On some occasions, namely non-Olympic modalities, knee and elbow strikes\nare involved [5]. MMA allow both grappling and striking techniques following the specific\nrules of this sport.  Similar to the previously mentioned sports, aerobic and anaerobic\nmetabolism are involved in the development of this discipline, due to the repetition of\nhigh-intensity efforts and combining the demands of grappling and striking [6]. It is im-\nportant to highlight that competitions in these disciplines are by weight category, which\nare established to match combat sports athletes with similar physical characteristics and\nthereby emphasise fair play. Most of the athletes try to reach the maximum (limit) weight\nof the category.  In addition, inappropriate weight loss strategies may negatively affect\nperformance [7].\nAn ergogenic aid is defined as a psychological technique, mechanical device, nutri-\ntional or pharmacological approach that can improve training adaptations and/or exercise\nperformance capacity [8]. Nutritional ergogenic aids (NEAs) are taken orally; they contain\nnutritional ingredients whose objectives are to improve sports performance and to avoid\nharmful effects on the individual (i.e., extraneous fatigue, dehydration and loss of physical\nskills, among others) [9]. The consumption of NEAs has increased in recent years around\nthe world, despite a 32.1% decline in sports supplements sales in 2020, the first year of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. It has been estimated that sports supplements sales will increase by\n10\u201311% between 2022 and 2028 [10]. There are no differences in supplement consumption\nby sex, but elite athletes usually take more dietary supplements than non-elite athletes [11].\nThere is no specific information about the consumption of supplements among combat\nsports practitioners, but there is no doubt about the potential ergogenic effect of these\ndietary supplements in specific sport modalities, because it is conditioned by the type of\neffort executed [12,13]. However, proper counselling based on current scientific evidence\nis required.\nSeveral organisations such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Aus-\ntralian Institute of Sport (AIS) have proposed classifications of sports supplements, group-\ning them into different categories according to safety, legality and effectiveness. Neverthe-\nless, there are no policies regarding the regulation of alleged benefits and safety claims, so\nin many cases, companies advertise their products without scientific evidence regarding\ntheir effect, dose or instructions for use [14,15]. This systematic review and meta-analyses\naimed at evaluating the scientific evidence concerning NEAs in the improvement of the per-\nformance of combat sports athletes specifically through published randomised controlled\ntrials (RCTs).\n\nNutrients2022,14, 25883 of 32\n- Materials and Methods\nThe conduct and reporting of the current systematic review conforms to the Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [16]. Using MeSH\nterms, three groups of combat sports were analysed regarding the efficacy of certain NEAs:\nmartial arts, boxing and wrestling.\n## 2.1. Systematic Search\nThe electronic databases Medline, Scopus and EBSCO (Sportdiscus) were searched to\nfind relevant articles identified by title and abstract (from inception to 31 May 2022) using\nthe search strategy described in Table 1. To perform a complete search, reference lists from\nreviews and relevant publications were manually searched to find additional publications\non the subject.\nTable 1.Combined Mesh terms used in the search of studies in database.\n## 1\n: NEAs filed in group A of AIS.\n## NEA\n## 1\n## Sport\nDietary supplements\n## AND\n## Martial Arts\nCaffeineBoxing\nCreatineWrestling\n## Beta-alanine\n## Sodium Bicarbonate\n## Nitrates\n## Glycerol\n## 2.2. Data Extraction\nTwo  reviewers  (N.V.S.  and  E.F.M.)  independently  extracted  the  characteristics  of\nthe retrieved RCTs and the outcomes of interest from full-text articles.  A third author\n(A.M.R.)  assessed  inter-reviewer  differences  (i.e.,  in  the  case  of  selecting  an  article  in\nwhich the authors evaluated a multi-ingredient supplement to evaluate its synergy but\nit  could  have  masked  the  real  effect  of  the  NEA).  The  following  data  were  extracted\nusing a predefined Microsoft Excel data extraction form: type of NEA, dose and time, the\nnumber of participants within each group, participant age and sex, combat sport discipline,\nmeasurement methods and main outcomes. This endeavour provided an overview table of\nall eligible studies.\n## 2.3. Study Selection\nThe inclusion criteria were: (a) no use of doping substances established by the WADA;\n(b) an RCT design that included one group receiving NEAs and\u22651 group(s) receiving a\nplacebo or not receiving supplementation; (c) not including any ergogenic aids classified\nwithin  group  A  by  the  AIS  because  of  their  high  evidence  grade  [17];  (d)  not  taking\nsupplementation as a source of nutrients, such as bars, gels or drinks rich in carbohydrates,\nproteins and electrolytes; (e) not presenting medical supplementation to prevent or treat\nclinical issues; and (f) not grey literature (abstracts, conference proceedings or editorials)\nor reviews.\n2.4. Quality Assessment and Publication Bias\nEvaluation was carried out by two reviewers (N.V.S. and A.M.R.) working indepen-\ndently in order to assess risk of bias comprehensively. The characteristics of the retrieved\nRCTs were evaluated using the PEDro scale \u2018risk-of-bias\u2019 assessment tool [18]. The follow-\ning bias criteria were considered: eligibility criteria, randomisation, allocation, baseline,\nblinding of subjects and researchers, measures of one key outcome from >85% of the al-\nlocated subjects, data from placebo and experimental groups and statistical comparisons,\nincluding variability of measurements. Disagreements were resolved by consensus involv-\ning a third reviewer (E.F.M.) following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook\nfor Systematic Reviews of Interventions [19].\n\nNutrients2022,14, 25884 of 32\n## 2.5. Statistical Analysis\nA meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of caffeine supplementation on\nblood lactate, using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration,\nOxford, UK). The authors used a Microsoft Excel template to collect the relevant infor-\nmation regarding the studies that included caffeine supplementation and blood lactate\nmeasurements. The template included the following variables: study authors and year of\npublication, sports discipline, group, caffeine dose and pre- and post-combat or test blood\nlactate data.\nThe effect of caffeine supplementation was determined by calculating the difference in\nthe blood lactate before and after combat or a test. The blood lactate difference was subjected\nto inverse-variance weighting [20]. In addition, because not all the sports disciplines are the\nsame, they do not use the same kind of combat. Hence, the standardised mean difference\n(SMD) was used and combined with a random effects model [21].  The 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) was determined to evaluate the size of the changes.\n## I\n## 2\nwas calculated to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies.I\n## 2\n## < 25%,\n>50% and >75% were considered to indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respec-\ntively. The Egger test was used to assess the publication bias by estimating the funnel plot\nasymmetry [22]. Statistical significance was set asp< 0.05.\n## 3. Results\n## 3.1. Included Studies\nA total of 547 studies were screened by title and abstract and 439 were assessed for\nthe eligibility criteria (full-text screening). From the retrieved articles, 55 met all inclusion\ncriteria and were included in the systematic review (Figure 1). Of these 55 studies, 45 were\nfound in Medline (two articles were not available despite requesting them from the cor-\nresponding author), seven were found in Scopus and three were retrieved from EBSCO\n(Sportdiscus) (Table 2). The PRISMA flowchart illustrating the step-by-step exclusion of un-\nrelated/duplicate records, leading to the final selection of 55 RCTs that met the predefined\ninclusion criteria, is shown in Figure 1.\n\nNutrients2022,14, 25885 of 32\nTable 2.Included studies of nutritional ergogenic aids in combat sports. 1RM: one-repetition maximum; BA: beta-alanine; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor;\nCAF: caffeine; CMJ: countermovement jump; EMG: electromyography; FFA: free fatty acids; FSKT: frequency speed of kick test multiple; HIIR: high intensity\ninterval run; HS: handgrip maximal strength; IGF-1: insulin-like growth factor 1; JGST: judogi grip strength test; KSAT: karate-specific aerobic test; MMA: mixed\nmartial arts; PSTT: progressive specific taekwondo test; PWPT: Pittsburgh wrestling performance test; SB: sodium bicarbonate; SFJT: special fitness judo test; TAIKT:\ntaekwondo anaerobic intermittent kick test; TSAT: taekwondo-specific agility test; TTE: time to exhaustion; UBISP: upper-body intermittent sprint performance test.\nStudyNEADosage/TimeDurationParticipants (Gender)\n## Age\n## (yrs)\nCombat SportLevelExercise ProtocolMain Outcomes\n## Striking Combat Sports\n## [23] Ouergui\net al.

Participants\nThe participants in the examined studies ranged from 16.1 to 29.9 years old, meaning that\nthey included junior to senior athletes. The level ranged from amateur to professional in both\nsexes, with a majority of male athletes (n= 726) compared with female athletes (n= 78) and non-\ndetermined gender because the studies did not report it(n= 150) [27,34,37,45,57,58,63\u201365,69].\nMost studies focussed on grappling disciplines(n= 33) [42\u201374], followed by striking disci-\nplines (n= 15) [23\u201341], mixed disciplines(n= 1) [75]and combat sports in general since\nthey were not identified in the methodology (n= 2) [76,77]. In the case of NEAs, caffeine\nwas the most evaluated supplement (n= 26) [23\u201330,42\u201358], followed by plasma buffers\n(n= 19)[31\u201334,59\u201365,76], nitric oxide (NO) precursors (n= 8) [39\u201341,70\u201373,77], creatine\n(n= 4) [31,38,68,69] and hydration agents (n= 1) [74].\n3.4. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids and Intervention Characteristics in Striking Combat Sports\nCaffeine was the most tested NEA with eight studies (Table 2). All trials had a duration\nof 1 day with variations in concentrations and timing. Most studies used a caffeine dose of\n5\u20136 mg/kg 30\u201360 min before the tests [24,26\u201330], with improvements in specific combat\nskills such as the effort\u2013pause ratio and time of punching sequences during a simulated\nboxing combat and a greater number of attacks (+5\u201315% successful kicks or +27% in the\nnumber of attacks compared with the placebo group [25,30]) and less reaction and skipping\ntime in simulated taekwondo combats compared with the placebo groups. General skills\nsuch as power (+2.3\u20136.8%), jump height (+5.1% [26]), time to exhaustion (TTE; +5.6% [27]),\nblood lactate (+20.0\u201326.2% [26,29,30]) and glycolytic energy contribution (+24.8\u201367.2% [29])\nwere higher than the placebo groups, while fatigue perception was lower (\u221261.5% [24]).\nOnly one study used a lower caffeine dose (3 mg/kg 60 min before the test) and found an\nimprovement in the number of kicks and the specific taekwondo agility test but without\nchanges in fatigue perception [23]. Other protocols with mouth rinsing with 6 mg/kg of\ncaffeine just before the tests in taekwondo athletes showed an increase in the percentage\nof successful kicks and less perceptual training intensity during a specific taekwondo test\ncompared with the placebo group during a Ramadan period [25].\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258821 of 32\nNEAs related to plasma buffer function have been evaluated by three 1-day and\ntwo3\u20135-daystudies.  A load of 0.3 g/kg of sodium bicarbonate taken for 3 days before\nthe test and intake of 0.1 g/kg 120, 90 and 30 min before a karate-specific test produced\nimprovements in TTE (+8.9%), but maintenance of vertical jumps, blood lactate and heart\nrate compared with the placebo group [27]. In addition, for a higher sodium bicarbonate\ndose taken for 5 days (4\u00d70.125 g/kg/day\u22480.5 g/kg/day), there were improvements\nin power (+18.4%) in a specific taekwondo test accompanied by a significant decrease in\nlactate after the test [31].  For the 1-day protocol, 0.3 g/kg of sodium bicarbonate taken\n60\u201390 min before the test increased TTE (+55.5%), blood lactate (+39.5%), pH (+1.4%),\nglycolytic energy contribution, attack time and punch efficacy, with different results on the\nheart rate [32,33].\nThere  has  been  only  one  study  that  combined  caffeine  with  sodium  bicarbonate\nregarding striking combat sports [27]. During a 3-day protocol, karate athletes ingested\n0.3 g/kg/day of sodium bicarbonate. On the test day, they consumed 6 mg/kg of caffeine\n60 min before and 0.1 g/kg of caffeine 120, 90 and 60 min before the test.  The authors\nreported only a higher TTE (+9.3%) relative to the placebo group, while the highest vertical\njump, blood lactate and heart rate were not different compared with the placebo group.\nBoth NEAs consumed together did not show any advantage compared when they were\nconsumed separately [27].\nBeta-alanine, which has a role as an intracellular buffer precursor, has been used\nin three studies examining striking combat sports [35\u201337].  All the studies used boxers\nas volunteers.   One study  lasted 10 weeks  with a  dose of 4.9\u20135.4  g/day and showed\nimprovements in general fitness (as peak power in lower limbs and less power drop in\nupper limbs, but not in strength or blood lactate levels) [36]. The other two studies, which\nlasted 4 weeks using 6 g/day or 0.3 g/kg/day of beta-alanine, observed mixed results in\nblood lactate levels compared with the placebo group [35,37]. Furthermore, the authors\nshowed improvements using beta-alanine in specific combat skills, namely a higher number\nand force of punches, but only as a time\u00d7group interaction [37], and there were no changes\nin power or the fatigue index [35].\nTwo studies evaluated the efficacy of creatine monohydrate in taekwondo practitioners.\nA dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks did not offer advantages compared with the placebo\ngroup regarding power or fatigue perception. It only produced a significant increase in\nblood triglycerides [38]. On the other hand, a higher dose over less time (4\u00d75 g/day for\n5 days) offered improvements in power (+17.3%) after a specific taekwondo test without\naffecting lactate levels [31].\nOnly one study has examined the combination of creatine and sodium bicarbonate,\nspecifically in striking combat sports [31]. During a 5-day protocol, taekwondo athletes\ningested 0.5 g/kg/day of sodium bicarbonate and 4\u00d75 g/day of creatine. Compared with\nthe placebo group, peak (+28.3%) and mean (+39.2%) power were significantly higher and\nblood lactate levels were lower after a specific test. Both NEAs consumed together showed\nadvantages in mean power compared with when they were consumed separately [31].\nThere are studies that have examined NO precursors. Intake of 2 g/kg beetroot juice\n150 min before the test in boxers did not produced differences in blood lactate levels or heart\nrate compared with the placebo group, but there was a significant decrease in power [41].\nThe same 1-day protocol with a controlled quantity of nitrate (NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\n; 400 or 800 mg) in\ntaekwondo practitioners did not produce differences in the number of kicks, general fitness\n(TTE, jump height, anaerobic performance and heart rate), blood lactate levels or perceptual\ntraining intensity [39]. However, 1 g of beetroot extract improved VO\n## 2\npeak (+10.0%) and\nthe anaerobic threshold (+13.5%) compared with the placebo group without affecting blood\nlactate levels [40].\n3.5. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids and Intervention Characteristics in Grappling Combat Sports\nFor striking combat sports, caffeine has been the most tested NEA in the grappling\nmodality with 17 studies, with judo being the most evaluated discipline (Table 2).  Caf-\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258822 of 32\nfeine has been tested in judoists 60 min before the exercise protocol with a dose ranging\nfrom 3 to 9 mg/kg [43,45,47,49\u201352,54,56,58].  Specific skills including the number of to-\ntalthrows [47,49,52,54,56], total attacks [49\u201351], the special fitness judo test (SFJT) index\n(expressed as heart rate divided by total throws) [52,56] and handgripstrength [43,45,51]\nshowed mixed results regardless of the dose used. General skills or physiological responses\nsuch as heart rate [45,47,49,52,56], and fatigue or effortperception [45,47,49,50,52,54,56,58]also\nproduced mixed results, while only blood lactate levels (+14.8\u201354.1% [47,51,54,56]) increased\nwith a dose ranging from 5 to 6 mg/kg compared with the placebogroups [47,51,54,56].\nHeight or power of jumps did not change compared with the placebo group [51], but the\nreaction time and power showed significant improvements [58]. Velocity in the execution\nof some resistance exercises also was improved with the consumption of 3\u20136 mg/kg of\ncaffeine [43].  Other grappling disciplines such as wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu used\nsimilar caffeine protocols with doses ranging from 3 to 10 mg/kg 30\u201360 min before the\ntests [42,44,45,48,53,55,57]. In the case of combat skills, time to complete a specific wrestling\ntest [48], the number of attacks but not defensive actions [55] and handgrip strength [45,55]\nwere improved with 3\u20136 mg/kg of caffeine compared with the placebo group. Focussing\non general physical aptitudes, wrestlers showed less improvement in jump height with\na dose of 4\u201310 mg/kg of caffeine than Brazilian jiu-jitsu athletes, with better results in\nstatic lifts and weight, power and velocity in 1RM (increasing the repetitions in bench\npress compared with the placebo) taking 3 mg/kg of caffeine [42,44,48,53,55]. There were\ninconsistent changes in heart rate regardless of the caffeine dose [42,45,48,57], a trend to\nincrease blood lactate for doss ranged from 3 to 6.2 mg/kg [48,55,57] and no changes in\nhydration status (based on urine osmolality and specific gravity) for doss < 10 mg/kg [48].\nLastly, in the case of effort perception, 5.2\u20136 mg/kg caffeine was optimal [48,53,55,57]. The\nuse of caffeinated chewing gums (2.7\u20135.4 mg/kg of caffeine) by judoists 15 min before\na test did not improve specific combat skills (total throws or the SFJT index) or general\nphysiological aspects (blood lactate, heart rate or perceptual training intensity [46].\nDifferent plasma buffers have also been evaluated, including sodium bicarbonate\nand  sodium  citrate  [54,59\u201365].   A  load  of  0.5  g/kg  of  sodium  bicarbonate  offered  for\n7  days  [62]  or  an  increasing  dose  ranging  from  0.025  to  0.1  g/kg  g/kg  provided  for\n10 days [60,61] produced a dose\u2013response relationship in terms of improvements in power\n(+13.7\u201316.0% [62,63])and total work (+8.0% [62]), but mixed results in terms of blood lactate\nlevels. Even with a high dose there were no improvements in effort or fatigue perception\ncompared with the placebo group [62]. Acute doses of sodium bicarbonate (0.1\u20130.3 g/kg)\n60\u2013120 min before tests improved specific skills such as throws (+4.9\u20135.1% [54,63]) in ju-\ndoists in a dose\u2013response manner [54,63] but not handgrip strength in jiu-jitsu athletes [59].\nThis dosing regimen produced higher power (+16.0% [63]) and significantly increased\nblood lactate levels (+17.8\u201326.3%) after specific judo tests [54,63] but not after anaerobic\ngeneral tests (Wingate test) or handgrip and forearm strength contraction tests [59,63]. Simi-\nlarly to long protocols with sodium bicarbonate, there were no changes in effort and fatigue\nperception with acute doses [54,63].  Sodium citrate has been evaluated in two studies\nusing 0.6\u20130.9 g/kg 16 h, 8 h and 30\u2013120 min before upper-body intermittent sprint per-\nformance tests in wrestlers and Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners [64,65]. Although the dose\nrange elevated blood pH and improved water intake retention and plasma volume, only\n0.9 g/kg of sodium citrate increased blood lactate levels (+15.0%) [64]. Power; heart rate;\nfatigue perception; and urine volume, osmolality and specific gravity were not significantly\ndifferent compared with the placebo group.\nOnly one study used a combination of caffeine with sodium bicarbonate in judoists [54].\nParticipants ingested for 1 day 6 mg/kg of caffeine 60 min before the test with 0.1 g/kg of\nsodium bicarbonate 60, 90 and 120 min before a specific performance judo test. The number\nof throws was higher (+7.8% [54]) than the placebo group\u2014and even compared with\ncaffeine or sodium bicarbonate consumed separately\u2014and the blood lactate levels were\nelevated (+21.9% [54]), while there were no significant differences in perceptual training\nintensity [54].\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258823 of 32\nBeta-alanine, an intracellular buffer precursor, has been evaluated in three studies\nfocussing on grappling combat sports [62,66,67]. A dose of 4.4 g/day for 8 weeks in amateur\nwrestlers did not improve general test performance (running time, flexed arm hang time or\nblood lactate levels) [67]. On the other hand, when the dose was increased to 6.4 g/day for\n4 weeks, judoists and jiu-jitsu practitioners showed a higher number of throws (+9.0% [66]),\nhigher total work (+7.0% [62]) and greater mean power (+6.5\u201310.5% [62]) (but not peak)\nbut no changes in blood pH and perceptual effort [62,66].\nTo assess the possible synergistic effect with the combination of intramuscular and\nplasma buffers, judoists and jiu-jitsu volunteers followed a 4-week beta-alanine protocol\nusing 6.4 mg/day with a 7-day sodium bicarbonate protocol (0.5 g/kg) [62]. In the general\nWingate anaerobic test, the mean power (+8.6\u201320.3%) and peak power (+15.3\u201322.3%) were\nhigher than the placebo group and during more bouts than sodium bicarbonate or beta-\nalanine consumed separately. Moreover, total work was even higher that the consumption\nof beta-alanine or sodium bicarbonate alone. Blood lactate was significantly higher than\nthe placebo group and the perceptual training intensity was lower (taking these NEAs\nseparately did not affect this parameter) [62].\nThe effect of creatine has been evaluated in two studies in amateur wrestlers and\nBrazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners, one of them with a load of 0.3 g/kg/day for 5 days [68],\nand the other for 15 days [69]. There were improvements relative to the control group in\nhandgrip strength and agility [69] but no significant changes in peak and mean power,\nblood lactate levels, heart rate, fatigue perception or urine specific gravity [68].\nFour studies have evaluated NO precursors:  one of them using beetroot juice [70],\nanother using a beetroot-based gel [71] and the other two examining different arginine\nprotocols [72,73]. Ingestion of 600 mg of NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\ncontained in beetroot juice 150 min before an\nisokinetic strength test increased the peak of strength only in the upper limbs (+13.4\u201315.1%),\nwhile the mean strength was improved in the upper and lower limbs (+9.6\u201316.6%) [70].\nIntake of 12.2 mmol of NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\ncontained in a beetroot-based gel by amateur Brazilian jiu-\njitsu volunteers for 8 days resulted in a significant increase in maximal voluntary forearm\ncontraction and muscle oxygen saturation during a forearm isometric test, and a significant\ndecrease in blood lactate (\u221229.3%) after exercise [71].  Long protocols with 6 g/day of\narginine for 3 days in judoists only increased blood arginine levels without affecting power\nand blood lactate after an intermittent anaerobic test [73].  In the case of acute protocols\nusing 150 mg/kg of arginine 60 min before a cycloergometer test in wrestlers, there was\nonly an improvement in TTE (+5.8% [72]) and no changes in blood lactate, heart rate or\n## VO\n## 2\n## [72].\nLastly, among hydration agents only glycerol has been examined [74]. Consumption\nof 1 g/kg glycerol 60 min before the Wingate test by wrestlers did not alter anaerobic power,\nbody mass, urine specific gravity and saliva osmolality.\n3.6. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids and Intervention Characteristics in Other Combat Sports\nCaffeine as an NEA to improve punching has been examined in MMA (Table 2) [75].\nConsuming 5 mg/kg of caffeine 60 min before the test did not alter punch frequency, punch\nforce or perceptual training intensity compared with the placebo group.\nA long protocol with 10 g/day of sodium bicarbonate (21 days) before the Wingate test\nin non-specified combat sports increased total work (+10.9%) and peak (+10.7%) and mean\n(+11.4%) power only in the upper limbs [76].  Blood lactate levels were higher (+13.7%)\nthan the placebo group while other biochemical parameters such as insulin-like growth\nfactor 1 (IGF-1) and cortisol increased and decreased, respectively.\nIn a study in which the authors did not specify the combat disciplines, participants\nwere given a beetroot-based gel containing 12.2 mmol of NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\n120 min before a forearm\nmuscle isometric strength test and handgrip isotonic exercise [77].  Compared with the\nplacebo group, there was a significant increase in maximal voluntary forearm contraction\nbut not changes in muscle oxygen saturation, time until fatigue and blood volume in\nthe forearm.\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258824 of 32\n3.7.

Forest plot results of a random effects meta-analysis for the placebo group compared with\nthe experimental (caffeine) group [26,27,29,30,45,46,47,48,50,54,55,56,57].\n## 4. Discussion\n4.1. Effects of Caffeine in Combat Sports\nCaffeine  exerts  its  role  as  an  agonist  of  adenosine  A1  and  A2a  receptors  [78],\nmodulating central nervous system activity by inhibiting parasympathetic activity. At the\nmetabolic  level,  caffeine  leads  to  elevated  blood  norepinephrine  levels,  enhancing\nglycolytic  activity  to  increase  muscle  energy  supply  during  high-intensity  exercise\n[79,80,81].  Caffeine  is  an  effective  ergogenic  aid  for  aerobic  and  anaerobic  exercise,\nproviding improvements in performance and the perceptions of exertion and muscle pain\nwith doses ranging from 2.35 to 5 mg/kg [82,83]. Coffee and derivates are habitual drinks\nin many cultures around the world, so it is common for athletes to consume caffeine from\nthese sources. It does not seem that habitual caffeine consumption affects the ergogenic\neffects of caffeine [84].\nCombat sports involve a multitude of muscle groups and high-intensity intermittent\nactions,  due  to  the  large  number  of  attacks  with  great  force  and  speed  that  utilise  the\nenergy provided from the anaerobic metabolic pathway. Although studies indicate that\nFigure 2.Forest plot results of a random effects meta-analysis for the placebo group compared with\nthe experimental (caffeine) group [26,27,29,30,45\u201348,50,54\u201357].\n## 4.

Effects of Caffeine in Combat Sports\nCaffeine exerts its role as an agonist of adenosine A1 and A2a receptors [78], modulat-\ning central nervous system activity by inhibiting parasympathetic activity. At the metabolic\nlevel, caffeine leads to elevated blood norepinephrine levels, enhancing glycolytic activity\nto increase muscle energy supply during high-intensity exercise [79\u201381].  Caffeine is an\neffective ergogenic aid for aerobic and anaerobic exercise, providing improvements in\nperformance and the perceptions of exertion and muscle pain with doses ranging from\n2.35 to 5 mg/kg [82,83]. Coffee and derivates are habitual drinks in many cultures around\nthe world, so it is common for athletes to consume caffeine from these sources. It does not\nseem that habitual caffeine consumption affects the ergogenic effects of caffeine [84].\nCombat sports involve a multitude of muscle groups and high-intensity intermittent\nactions, due to the large number of attacks with great force and speed that utilise the energy\nprovided from the anaerobic metabolic pathway. Although studies indicate that the aerobic\nenergy pathway is the main one and contributes to the recovery process during breaks\nbetween rounds, the decisive actions are maintained by anaerobic processes [85\u201390].  In\ncombat sports, most studies have analysed caffeine doses from 5 to 10 mg/kg and have re-\nported improvements in various aspects of performance. In both specific and general skills,\nthe improvements are based mainly on abilities related to glycolytic metabolism: the effort\u2013\npause ratio, the time of punching sequences, the number of attacks, reaction and skipping\ntime, handgrip strength, power, static lifts and TTE, among others [24\u201328,30,49,52,58]. More\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258825 of 32\nstudies that evaluate the combination of caffeine and sodium bicarbonate are necessary to\nverify a clear synergistic response, because the available results are heterogenous [27,54]\nas well as compared to the conclusion reached in other studies [91].  In this regard, ath-\nletes are able to reach higher intensity levels due to a greater production and tolerance\nof blood lactate levels (2.1\u201320.9 vs. 3.2\u201318.9 mmol/L in the caffeine and placebo groups,\nrespectively) through the use of the glycolytic pathways for energy production (Figure 2).\nThese findings are similar to results observed in disciplines where glycolytic metabolism is\ninvolved [92\u201394].\nThe results that caffeine consumption increased blood lactate levels compared with\nthe placebo group are consistent with the results of a recent review [95].  Although this\nreview explained that caffeine increases the blood lactate concentration, it is necessary\nto consider that caffeine ingestion is used to enhance an athlete\u2019s physical performance,\nand it could allow them to produce more intense efforts for a longer time. This sustained\neffort could lead to higher blood lactate levels.   On the other hand,  the perception of\neffort was improved when using a range of 4\u201310 (5\u00d72) mg/kg of caffeine in only five\nstudies [24,25,42,48,52],  with a fair score on the PEDro scale for one of them [25].   In\n12 studies that provided the participants with 3\u20139 mg/kg caffeine, there was no difference\ncompared with the placebo group, or even an increased feeling of fatigue coinciding with\nthe lowestdoses [27\u201330,49,50,53\u201355,57,58,75].  These findings are consistent with results\nin other disciplines [96]. In 1- and 3-day protocols with caffeine and sodium bicarbonate,\ncaffeine did not improve perceived exertion [27,54]. Additional studies are necessary with\nhigher doses of caffeine to determine whether there is a strong effect in the effort perception\nduring high-intensity tasks.\n4.2. Effects of Buffering Supplements in Combat Sports\nBicarbonate coming from carbon dioxide (CO\n## 2\n) acts as the main mechanism to buffer\nplasma acidification.  Normally, a drop in muscle and plasma pH occurs during high-\nintensity exercise, because acid (H\n## +\n) and CO\n## 2\ntend to accumulate [97]. The efficacy of acute\nsodium bicarbonate supplementation is influenced by the duration of exercise. Specifically,\nsports of prolonged duration (>4 min) have shown mixed results with the use of sodium\nbicarbonate supplementation, improving performance in running and cycling, but not in\nrowing, rugby, water polo or basketball [97].  Because sodium bicarbonate could cause\ngastrointestinal discomfort [98], other buffer supplements such as sodium citrate have been\ntested.  On the other hand, beta-alanine acts as intracellular buffer, increasing carnosine\ncontent and, subsequently, improving high-intensity exercise capacity in cycling [99]. A\nmeta-analysis revealed improved high-intensity endurance performance from 30 s to 10 min\nin duration [100].\nAn acute dose of 0.3 g/kg of sodium bicarbonate for 1 or 3 days improved the number\nof throws, power and TTE in combat sports [27,32\u201334,63]. This finding is similar to studies\nwith racquet sports, where specific skills and TTE tended to improve [94].  On the other\nhand, the same protocol could not improve handgrip strength and total forearm contrac-\ntions [59]. Lower doses had little to no effect on the number of throws (until 0.1 g/kg) [54]\nand the power (in a protocol of progressive dose increase from 0.025 g/kg to 0.1 g/kg over\n10 days) [60,61]. Despite improvements in punch efficacy, attack time and total work used\nfor sports [27,32\u201334], additional studies are needed with more participants and a more\nextensive dose range to verify this fact.  Regarding physiological aspects, there was an\nincrease in blood lactate, without affecting heart rate or fatigue perception, using high\ndoses (0.3 and 0.5 g/kg 60\u201390 min but not 120 min before the exercise or 10 g/day for\n1 week) in different protocols [32,33,62,63,76] but mixed results were obtained with lower\ndoses [54,60,61]. An exception was the decrease in blood lactate after a taekwondo-specific\ntest with 0.5 g/kg/day of sodium bicarbonate for 5 days with or without creatine [31]. The\nsignificant increase in blood lactate levels compared with the placebo group could be due\nto carboxylate co-transporter, which extracts lactate and H\n## +\nfrom working muscle cells\nto the circulation after an increase in extracellular pH [101] and an increase in glycolytic\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258826 of 32\nactivity. It seems that only doses\u22650.3 g/kg sodium bicarbonate produced an increase in\npH and glycolytic energy contribution, but more studies using a wide range of doses are\nnecessary to determine the optimal dose and to standardise exercise protocols.\nProtocols using sodium citrate showed similar results regarding blood lactate (but\nonly with one study using 0.9 g/kg for one day [64]) and pH increase (with a 1-day protocol\nproviding 0.6\u20130.9 g/kg [64,65]).  These results are similar to those observed with lower\ndoses (0.5 g/kg) in intermittent sports such as tennis [92] and in swimmers using 0.3 g/kg\nin a 400 m time-trial test [93]. While in tennis, but not in swimming, some specific skills\nwere improved, in combat sports they were not tested [64,65,92,93].  Sodium citrate has\nalso demonstrated improvements in water intake retention and plasma volume (without\naffecting dehydration parameters measured in urine) [65], perhaps due to its influence\non hormone diuresis control [102]. Similar to sodium bicarbonate, there were no changes\ncompared with the placebo group in terms of heart rate or fatigue perception.\nIntracellular buffering using 4.9\u20136.4 g/day of beta-alanine for 4\u201310 weeks in combat\nsports improved power in general physical tests for both striking and grappling disci-\nplines  [36,62].   On  the  other  hand,  strength,  total  work  or  running  time  showed  less\nevidence of benefits [35,36,62,67].  Specific combat skills, such as punch efficacy and the\nnumber of throws, tended to improve with beta-alanine supplementation (6.0\u20136.4 g/day\nfor 4 weeks) [37,66]. However, more studies are necessary to obtain stronger evidence, be-\ncause other athletes such as climbers\u2014who perform a large amount of isometric work with\nforearm muscles, similar to grappling fighters\u2014showed improvements in repeated high-\nintensity intermittent upper body performance with lower doss (4 g/d during 4 weeks) [103].\nRegarding physiological improvements with beta-alanine supplementation, mixed results\nhave been obtained regarding blood lactate levels [36,37,62,66,67]. There were no changes\nin blood pH [66] or fatigue perception when beta-alanine was used alone\u2014but fatigue\nperception was enhanced when used together with sodium bicarbonate [62].\nBuffering supplements appear to have greater benefits in grappling disciplines, but\nadditional investigation is necessary with the aim of achieving strong evidence regarding\nthe optimal dose range that positively affects specific combat skills, as well as its possible\nsynergistic effects with the combination of several of them and other NEAs (i.e., caffeine).\n4.3. Effects of Creatine Monohydrate in Combat Sports\nCreatine  monohydrate  supplementation  has  been  used  as  a  strategy  to  increase\nstrength and muscle mass during training, but it has also been reported to improve power\nand anaerobic capacity [104\u2013106]. Thus, the use of creatine in combat sports such as judo is\nof great interest because about 10% of elite Japanese and Korean judoists take it [107].\nThe use of high doses of creatine (0.3 g/kg/day or 20 g/day) for 5\u201315 days improved\nperformance (agility and power) [31,69] and combat skills in grappling disciplines (hand-\ngrip strength) [69], but the study obtained a fair score for the PEDro scale. The results are in\nthe line with other intermittent disciplines such as racquet sports, where only 0.3  g/kg for\n5 days improved sprint time in squash players [94]. Additional studies with specific-combat\ntests, better-quality experimental design (similar baseline sample inclusion criteria and\nblinding subjects, therapists and assessors regarding the treatments) and greater homo-\ngeneity in the protocols are necessary to confirm this fact with a wide range of doses and in\nstriking disciplines. At present, there is no evidence for its recommendation.\n4.4. Effects of Nitric Oxide Precursors in Combat Sports\nNO  has  a  relevant  role  as  an  intracellular  second  messenger  and  its  production\nis also related to an increase in blood flow, which improves nutrient and hormone de-\nlivery.   Furthermore,  NO  has  a  positive  impact  on  resistance  and  endurance  training\nadaptions [108,109].  Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses about NO synthase\u2013\nindependent pathway supplementation have shown that sodium nitrate and potassium\nnitrate are less effective than beetroot juice consumption in endurance exercise. The use\nof 6\u201312 mmol of NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\ncontained in beetroot juice supplements produced significant im-\n\nNutrients2022,14, 258827 of 32\nprovements in time to exhaustion in a 5\u201330 min cycling race, but slightly non-significant\nimprovements in time trial or graded-exercise performance [80]. Regarding combat sports,\nneither 2 g/kg of beetroot juice [41] nor 400 and 800 mg of NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\ncontained in the juice [39]\nproduced performance advantages; indeed, there were negative effects on power compared\nwith the placebo group [41].  Misinformation regarding the NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\nconcentration of the\nproduct [41] did not permit determining whether the ergogenic dose established in other\nsports trials was achieved.  On the other hand, beetroot-based gel supplementation for\n8 days or 120 min before exercise increased maximal voluntary forearm contraction and\nmuscle oxygen saturation and decreased blood lactate levels after exercise (improvements\nin lactate clearance) compared with the placebo group in an isometric test exercise [71,77].\nIn this case, the NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\nconcentration was 12.2 mmol, near the upper end of the range\nestablished for other studies with improvements in performance [110,111]. Beetroot extract\n(without information on the NO\n## 3\n## \u2212\ncontent) taken before exercise improved VO\n## 2\npeak\nand the anaerobic threshold without affecting blood lactate levels [40]. More studies are\nnecessary using beetroot-based products and well-established nitrate-containing beetroot\njuices in specific combat tests before providing adequate advice for combat sports.\nIn  the  case  of  NO  synthase\u2013dependent  pathway,  supplementing  l-arginine  as  its\nnatural precursor is not classified as a group A aid by the AIS, but recent publications\nhave shown interesting data that could support its use [112]. Anaerobic performance, the\nmain pathway to obtain energy during high-intensity actions in combat sports, is enhanced\nby acute (0.15 g/kg of l-arginine 60\u201390 min before exercise) and chronic (10\u201312 g/day for\n8 weeks) use [112].  Only an acute protocol with 150 mg/kg of l-arginine 60 min before\nexercise enhanced TTE in wrestlers [72], according to meta-analyses results [112], but the\nstudy obtained a fair score on the PEDro scale.  A chronic protocol with a lower dose\n(6 g/day of l-arginine) than the range established as ergogenic and taken for less time\n(3 days) had no effects in judoists [73].  In this sense, it is too early to establish a robust\nrecommendation regarding l-arginine supplementation.\n4.5. Effects of Glycerol Supplementation in Combat Sports\nGlycerol is a metabolite that acts as a plasma expander and could help athletes main-\ntain euhydration and improve thermoregulatory and cardiovascular changes [9]. Until 2018,\nWADA had considered glycerol a banned substance because it was believed that it could\nalter an athlete\u2019s biological passport [113]. In any case, the results of its supplementation\nare mixed, both in endurance and anaerobic disciplines [8].  In combat sports, 1.0 g/kg\nglycerol before the Wingate test in wrestlers could not improve anaerobic power and did\nnot affect body mass, urine specific gravity or saliva osmolality [74].  More research is\nneeded to determine glycerol\u2019s supposed potential efficacy in combat sports in specific\ntests and in more disciplines.\n## 5. Conclusions\nCaffeine is the NEA for which there is clear evidence of benefits for combat sports\npractitioners. Acute doses (5\u201310 mg/kg) 30\u201360 min before combat may improve specific\nskills that rely on glycolytic metabolism to obtain energy, but it may not contribute to\nimprove perceived exertion.   Even though some evidence concludes that other NEAs\nshow promise in improving performance, such as buffering supplements, more studies\nare necessary, specifically for grappling disciplines, to verify its validity during sustained\nisometric efforts.  Creatine, NO precursors or glycerol could play an interesting role in\nimproving performance, but more studies are needed to strengthen the evidence.\n## Author Contributions:\nConceptualisation, N.V.-S. and A.M.-R.; methodology, N.V.-S. and A.M.-R.;\nprotocol drafting, N.V.-S.; risk of bias, N.V.-S. and A.M.-R.; quality assessment, N.V.-S. and A.M.-R.;\ndata extraction, N.V.-S. and E.F.-M.; literature search, N.V.-S. and E.F.-M.; search flowchart,N.V.-S.;\nwriting\u2014original  draft  preparation,  N.V.-S.  and  A.M.-R.;  writing\u2014review  and  editing,  N.V.-S.,\nA.M.-R. and E.F.-M.

Using  an  appropriate  diet  plan  is  a\nproven  method  to  optimize  performance  improvements  in  combat  sports.  In  the  majority  of  combat\nsports  athletes  are  classified  according  to  their  body  mass  in  order  to  minimize  differences  between\ncompetitors. Many athletes induce weight loss in order to gain an advantage over their opponents. The\nreview was undertaken to provide safe, evidence-based protocols helping athletes in weight reduction\nwithout negative effects on sports performance. The nutritional requirements for combat sports athletes,\nsports supplements, gradual and rapid weight reduction strategies are discussed in this review.\nKeywords: combat sports; nutrition; supplementation; weight reduction\n\n## 1. Introduction\nCombat sport is a term used to describe a competitive contact sport where two combatants fight\nagainst each other using a particular contest\u2019s rules [1]. The most popular combat sports include\nwrestling,  judo,  kickboxing,  mixed  martial  arts,  boxing,  karate  and  taekwondo. In  the  majority  of\ncombat  sports, athletes are  classified according to their  body mass  in  order to  minimize differences\nbetween  competitors  including  body  size,  strength  and  agility  [2].  Most  combat  sports  may  be\nclassified as intermittent, high-intensity sports [3].\nThere are many methods that have proved to optimize performance improvements including an\nappropriate  diet  plan  or  using  sports  supplements.  Nutrition  as  the  aspect  closely  connected  to\n\n## 486\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\nphysical  activity  may  affect  body  composition,  sports  performance  and  post-workout  regeneration.\nThe  nutritional  requirements  for  athletes  are  higher  than  for  the  average  population  for  many\nnutrients.  In combat  sports  the  recommended  nutrition  and energy intake may  further  exceed levels\nfor non-training population [4].\n- Energy and carbohydrates\nThe  primary  component  to  optimize  sports  performance  in  combat  sports  is  ensuring  an\nadequate energy intake. The caloric needs for athletes training with moderate or high intensity may\napproach 40\u201370 kcals/kg/day depending on the intensity and frequency of trainings. For elite athletes\nthe recommended energy intake may further exceed these levels [5]. It has to be mentioned that the\nfundamental  factor  of  sports  nutrition  is  nutrient  timing  and  it  refers  to  the  time  when the  body  is\nable  to  use  macronutrients  most  effectively  [6].  The  timing  of  energy  intake  may  enhance  muscle\nprotein synthesis, recovery and tissue repair [5].\nThe primary source of energy for athletes are carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, as energy substrates,\ncan be oxidized via aerobic metabolism (for instance by glycolytic pathway coupled with Krebs cycle\nand  electron  transport  chain)  or  converted  into  lactate  via  anaerobic  metabolism  such  as  anaerobic\nglycolysis. As a result, adenosine triphosphate is synthesized and the energy is transferred. The ability to\nmaintain  exercise  is  connected  with  muscle  glycogen  content  [3].  It  has  been  proved  that  the  proper\nlevel  of  carbohydrates  in  a  diet  is  connected  with  a  higher  strength  and  muscle  glycogen  storage  [7].\nGlycogen is a fuel source of glucose, stored in the cytosol of cells. Skeletal muscle cells involve 1\u20132%\nof glycogen and liver cells include 5\u20136% of glycogen respectively. Glycogen stores in muscles and the\nliver  decrease  during  physical  activity.  The  prolongation  and  intensification  of  the  activity  leads  to  an\noverall reduction of glycogen stores [8]. The recommended intake of carbohydrates in an athletes\u2019 diet is\nrelated  to  the  type  and  intensity  of  trainings  and  should  vary  between  4\u20135  g/kg  to  8\u201310  g/kg of body\nmass.  High  intensity,  endurance  sports  are  related  to  greater  carbohydrate  intake  [9,5].  Combat  sports\ninclude  aerobic  and  anaerobic  metabolism  during  effort  and  can  deplete  glycogen  storage  during\ntraining [10]. In high intensity sports, such as combat sports, the intake of carbohydrates may gain 10\u2013\n12 g/kg of body mass daily [3]. Carbohydrate is the most important macronutrient in pre-exercise meal.\nIt  has  been  proved  that  ingesting  carbohydrates  before  training  improves  endurance  and  increases\nmuscle and liver glycogen [11,12]. One of the studies has shown that athletes consuming meals 3 hours\nbefore training had higher endurance than people training in the fasted state [13]. In another study, the\nauthors  investigated  that  consumption  of  a  high-carbohydrate  meal  4  hours  before  cycling  exercise  at\n70%  maximum  oxygen  intake  (VO2  max)  significantly  increased  muscle  and  liver  glycogen.  The\nexercise  was  taken  after  an  overnight  fast  and  lasted  105  minutes.  The  result  of  the  meal  consumed\nbefore exercise was an increased rate of carbohydrate oxidation and utilization of muscle glycogen [14].\nIt has to be pointed out that there are several types of carbohydrates which are metabolized differently\nby  the  body.  Differences  between  simple  and  complex  carbohydrates  are  related  to  their  ability  to  be\nabsorbed and used as a source of quick or more gradual energy [4]. It has been proved that the intake of\nlow  glycemic  index  of  carbohydrates  can  increase  the  durability  of  training  in  comparison  to  high\nglycemic  index products  [15].  However,  the  type,  intensity  and  the  length  of  time  between  trainings\nsessions seems to play a critical role. The athletes who train more than once a day with high intensity\nshould choose carbohydrates with high glycemic index in order to accelerate muscle glycogen synthesis\nbefore the second training session [9]. The consumption of carbohydrate is crucial after exercise because\n\n## 487\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\nit  enhances  the  recovery  process  and  restoration  of  the  glycogen  depleted  during  training  [3].  High-\nglycemic  products  may  restore  muscle  and  liver  glycogen  stores  more  quickly  in  comparision  to\ncomplex  carbohydrates  [8].  One  type  of  substances  used  to  improve  performance  during  training  is\nmaltodextrins.   Maltodextrins   are   saccharide   polymers   consisting   of   D-glucose   [16].   They   are\nhydrolyzed to free glucose molecules in the the small intestine and due to the low osmolality, they are\ncommonly  used  as  an  ingredient  of  sports  drinks  [17].  Consuming  30\u201360  g  of  high-glycemic  index\ncarbohydrates  during  an  exercise  lasting  more than  one  hour  maintains  high  rates  of  carbohydrates,\nprevents hypoglycemia and can result in performance benefit [3,18,19]. It has been scientifically proven\nthat   beverages   containing   more   than   one   source   of   transportable   carbohydrates   (for   example\nmaltodextrins  and  fructose)  stimulate  greater  carbohydrates  absorption  due  to  additional  transport\nmechanisms.  The  study  by  Wallis  et  al.  [16]  has  shown  that  in  ingestion  maltodextrin  and  fructose\nduring cycling exercise is related with higher oxidation rates than from ingesting maltodextrin alone.\n## 3. Protein\nThe important macronutrient in combat sports is protein. The recommended intake in an athlete\u2019s\ndiet is higher in comparison to non-training people in order to ensure regular muscle protein synthesis.\nMuscle mass  loss  can  have  a  negative  effect  on  strength,  power  and  performance  [20].  The  current\nprotein recommendations for athletes is to gain 1.2\u20132 g/kg of body mass [21]. It has been proved that\nthe  requirements  for  athletes  who  are  reducing  weight  can  be higher  and  the  recommended  level  of\nprotein intake can gain 1.8\u20132.7 g/kg of body mass in order to prevent muscle mass loss during energy\ndeficiency. Consumption of an appropriate amount of essential amino acids, particularly leucine, leads\nto muscle mass synthesis [22]. Essential amino acids cannot be synthetized de novo by the organism\nand must be supplied by the diet. Ingestion of essential amino acids in free form or as part of a protein\nbolus of 20\u201340 g after the exercise is known to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and could increase\nstrength  and  improve  body  composition  by  increasing  lean  body  mass [23]. A  proven  effect  on\nstimulating  muscle  protein  synthesis  consumed  after  an  exercise  session  refers  to,  for  instance,  milk:\nwhey,  casein,  and  soy  protein  [20,24].  Each  high-quality  protein  elicits  different  digestibility,\nphysiological  responses,  and  different  muscle  retention  [24].  Whey  and  soy  protein  have  rapid\ndigestion which leads to a large increase in the amount of amino acids in blood. On the opposite side,\ncasein  precipitates  and  coagulates  in  stomach  acid  and  the  absorption  and  digestion  is  lower  [3].\nFurthermore, whey and milk protein (containing both whey and casein) are able to stimulate superior\nmuscle protein synthesis than soy or casein [25].\n## 4. Fat\nThe  recommended  level  of  fat  in  athletes\u2019  diet  is  25\u201330%  of  energy  intake  and  the  most\npreferable  sources  of  fat  are  unsaturated  fatty  acids,  particularly  omega-3  polyunsaturated  fatty\nacids [9,26]. Omega-3  PUFAS  are  known  to  reduce  oxidative  stress  and  inflammation,  lower  the\nrisk of cardiovascular disease, reduce muscle soreness and increase muscle protein synthesis [27].\nThe study by Smith et al. [20] has shown that 8-weeks omega-3 supplementation including 1.86 g\nEPA  and  1.5  g  DHA/day  increased  muscle  protein  anabolic  response  to  hyperinsulinemia\u2013\nhyperaminoacidaemia in healthy young adults. Excessive consumption of trans and saturated fatty\nacids is connected with health implications and should be reduced in dietary intake. The nutritional\n\n## 488\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\nrequirements for fat should be mostly covered by vegetable oils, sea fish, nuts and seeds [9,26]. In\nsports, the  energy  for  cellular functions  is  derived from metabolism  glycogen  or triglycerides. By\nthe oxidative energy system, the oxygen is utilized in mitochondria of cells resulting in production\nof  ATP  [29].  During  light  and  moderate  exercises,  energy  needs  of  the  muscle  are  met  by\ncarbohydrates  and  free  fatty  acids  [26].  By  the  lipolysis,  triglycerides  stored  in  muscles  and\nadipose sites are metabolized into glycerol and free fatty acids. The maximal  fat  oxidation  can  be\nreached at approximately 47\u201352% of VO2 max in untrained individuals and 59\u201364% of VO2 max\nin  endurance-trained  athletes  [29]. In contrast to carbohydrates, fats are known to have unlimited\navailability. While increasing the duration of training, the carbohydrates stores are decreasing until\nthey are finally depleted [4].\n## 5. Water\nWater  is  a  crucial  ergogenic  aid  for  athletes  and  an  adequate  level  of  hydration  is  necessary  to\nmaintain  exercise  capacity  [30].  It  has  been  proved  that  2%  of  dehydration  can  impair  sports\nperformance.  Dehydration  of  4%  may  lead  to  serious  health  outcomes  such  as  heat  exhaustion,  heat\nstroke or heat illness [5]. It has been proposed that dehydration used for weight loss increases the risk\nof   acute   cardiovascular   problems   including   ischaemic   heart   disease   and   stroke.   Furthermore,\nsignificant levels of dehydration may alter the brain morphology and increase the risk of brain injury\nrelated  to  head  trauma  induced  by  strikes  [31].  The  physical  activity  induces  sweating  which  is  with\nmineral  loss,  particularly  sodium,  potassium,  calcium  and  magnesium  [32].  The  duration  of  training,\nheat  acclimatization,  weather  conditions  or  genetic  predisposition  influence  the  sweating level  and\ndetermine fluid needs [33]. Recent studies have shown that the type of the training plays an important\nrole  in  fluid  loss.  In  the  study  by Rivera-Brown  et  al.  [34]  authors  indicated  that  sweat  loss  and  the\nlevel  of  dehydration  during  training  in a tropical  climate  was  lower  in  intermittent  type  of  sport  in\ncomparision  to  continous  training.  The  appropriate  ratio  of  sodium  and  potassium  is  significant  for\nmaintaining adequate fluid balance or ensuring proper cardiovascular and nervous system function [32].\nThe  most  important  role  of  magnesium  and  calcium  in  the  context  of  sports  is  regulating  muscle\nfunction, stabilizing enzymic reactions, regulating energy production and facilitating transport of other\nnutrients  [35].  In  order  to  compensate  water  loss  induced  by  training,  athletes  should  consume\napproximately 0.5\u20132 L/hour of water or glucose-electrolyte solutions during exercise. A good strategy\nto monitor changes in fluid balance is weighing athletes before and after a training session in order to\nprovide  the  proper  level  of  hydration  and  increase  the  sports  performance  [5].  In  the  study  by\nStefanovsky  et  al. [36]  authors  have  shown  that  the  hydration  status  in  youth  judo  athletes  during  an\noff-season  was  not  optimal.  The  similar  results  have  been  indicated  in  the  research  by  Petterson  and\nBerg  [37]  where  89%  of  combat  sports  athletes  participating  in  the  study  were  hypohydrated  in  the\nmorning  of  the  competition  day.  An  effective  method  for  improving  short  duration  performance\nfollowing acute hypohydration may be passive heat- acclimation protocols [31].\n## 6. Supplements\nThe  influence  on  strength,  endurance  and  body  composition  may  also  have  sports  supplements.\nThere are many substances which have a proven impact on the effectiveness of training [38,39]. Using\nsupplements may delay the onset of fatigue and allow an athlete to train in higher intensity [3]. According\n\n## 489\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\nto  the  Australian  Institute  of  Sports,  supplement  ingredients  are  ranked  into  4  groups  in  order  to\ndetermine if the product is safe and effective at improving sports performance. Substances classificated in\ngroup A are scientifically proven to support, and enhance sports performance and prevent or treat clinical\nissues, for instance sports food, vitamin D, calcium, iron, caffeine or creatine. Substances ranked in group\nB are based on emerging scientific support and deserving of further research. The substances that have\nbeen classificated in group B are for example food polyphenols, fish oils, carnitine, vitamin C and E or\nBranched-Chain Amino Acids. In group C the supplements are not supportive of benefit amongst athletes\nand  substances  classified  in  the  group  D  are  banned  to  be  used  by  athletes  [40].  Substances  such  as\nstimulants, prohormones and hormone boosters, GH releasers and peptides are on the World Anti-Doping\nAgency (WADA) list and shouldn\u2019t be injected by athletes [41]. In combat sports, the benefits of using\nsupplements   may   be   provided   below   two   strategies- an   acute   supplementation   and   chronic\nsupplementation  strategy.  An  acute  supplementation  strategy  includes  the  consumption  of  supplements\nwhich have the ability to optimize performance improvements when used in the minutes to hours before\ntraining  or  competition.  A  chronic  supplementation  strategy  refers  to  the  consumption  of  sports\nsupplements that need to be used over a period including several days or weeks in order to enhance sports\nperformance [42].\nOne  of  the  substances  which  have  a  proven  ergogenic  effect  in  combat  sports  is  caffeine  [42].\nCaffeine  has  been  ranked  in  list  A  of the  Australian  Institute  of  Sports  [40]  and  can  be  found  in\nsupplements or food products such as coffee, tea, chocolate or energy drinks [30]. Supplementation with\n3\u20136 mg/kg of caffeine could increase the glycolytic contribution to energy metabolism. The ingestion of\ncaffeine may also improve levels of power, strength and upper arm muscular endurance [43]. The studies\nhave shown that 6 mg/kg of caffeine may decrease extracellular potassium concentration [44]. Ingesting\ncaffeine  60  minutes  before  training or competition  may  be  adequate  due  to  the  plasma  levels  peak  an\nhour after consuming caffeine [42]. However, it must be noticed that there are some studies showing no\nergogenic effect of caffeine supplementation in combat sports [45,46].\nAnother ergogenic supplement with evidence-based influence on performance that may be used\nin  combat  sports  is  sodium  bicarbonate.  Sodium  bicarbonate  is  an  alkalizing  agent  which  is  able  to\naugment extracellular buffering capacity [42]. During high-intensity exercises, carbon dioxide (CO\n## 2\n## )\nand hydrogen (H\n## +\n) cumulate in the blood and muscles. Through the bicarbonate system the body rids\nitself  of  the  hydrogen  and  CO\n## 2\nvia  their  conversion  to  bicarbonate  throughout  the  renal  and\nrespiratory system [5]. Sodium bicarbonate has been classified in group A in the list of the Australian\nInstitute  of  Sports  [40].  In  the  study  by  Artioli  et  al.  [47]  authors  have  demonstrated  that  the\ningestion  0.3  g/kg  of  sodium  bicarbonate  2  hours  before  exercise  improves  performance  in\nspecialized  judo-tests.  Similar  effects  were  shown  in  the  study  by  Lopes- Silva  et  al.  [48].\nSupplementation 300 mg/kg body mass of NaHCO 90 minutes before the combat simulation induced\nincreased  lactate  concentration  and  total  time  attack  in taekwondo  athletes.  Furthermore,  greater\nestimated glycolytic energy contribution in the first round was noticed when compared with placebo.\nSimilar  effects  may  be  achieved  with  a  chronic  supplementation  strategy.  One  of  the  studies  has\nshown  that  ingestion  500  mg  of  sodium  bicarbonate/kg  of  body  mass  split  in  5  or  4  smaller  doses\nimproves  work  output  for  two  days  after  cessation  of  ingestion  [49].  Nevertheless,  it  has  to  be\nnoticed that supplementing sodium  bicarbonate can  cause gastrointestinal  distress including nausea,\ndiarrhoea, vomiting  and  stomach  pain  [46].  The  method  which  is  used  to  minimize  the  risk  of\ngastrointestinal symptoms is by progressively increasing the doses of sodium bicarbonate. In a study\nby  Durkalec-Michalski,  the  researchers  used  a  progressive  protocol  lasting 10  days  starting  with\n\n## 490\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\n0.025 g/kg of body mass on two days and increasing the dose until the last day to 0.1 g/kg of body\nmass to ensure gastrointestinal distress [50].\nThe  ingestion  of  beta-alanine  could  also  be  beneficial  in  combat  sports.  It  has  been  proved  that\nusing  beta-alanine  supplements  increase  intramuscular  carnosine  levels.  Carnosine  is  a  dipeptide\nprolifically found in skeletal muscle, composed of histidine and beta-alanine. Carnosine is believed to\nexert  an  important  acid-base  regulation  function  [3].  After  ingestion,  carnosine  is  degraded  into\nhistidine and beta-alanine so that it doesn't increase skeletal muscle carnosine levels [42]. On the other\nhand, \u03b2-alanine  supplementation  increases  intramuscular  carnosine  levels.  Supplementation  with  1.6\u2013\n6.4 g/day for at least 4 weeks significantly increases muscle carnosine content by 40\u201380% in training\npopulation  [51].  Recent  studies  suggest  higher  efficacy  with  doses  up  to  12  g/day  [52].  Beta-alanine\ningestion  may  improve  anaerobic  threshold  meaning that  endurance  activities  can  be  performed  for\nlonger time at higher intensities [53]. Furthermore, beta-alanine ingestion may improve neuromuscular\nfatigue, increase lean body mass and training volume [5]. In one of the studies, 4-weeks beta-alanine\nsupplementation  significantly  enhanced  performance  in  the  Special  Judo  Fitness  Test-followed\nsimulated combats [54].\nProbably the most effective dietary supplement to increase high-intensity exercise performance in\ncombat  sports  is  creatine.  Injecting  creatine supplements  can  increase  intramuscular  phosphocreatine\n(PCr), which is an energy buffer protecting the ATP concentration [55]. Muscle PCr depletion during\nintensive  training  is  an  important  factor  causing  fatigue.  Increasing  intramuscular  PCr  emerges  can\ndelay  PCr  depletion  and  improve  anaerobic  performance  [3].  It  has  been  proved  that  creatine\nsupplementation  increases  strength,  power,  lean  body  mass  and  efficacy  in  high-intensity,  short-\nduration  exercises  [56].  In  Radvanovic  et  al.  study  [57],  judo  athletes were  given  22  g  of  creatine\nmonohydrate  per  day  (in  4  doses  of  5.5  g)  during  the  first  week  of  research  in  comparison  to  the\nplacebo group. In the second week, subjects in the creatine group were given 1 dose of 5.5 g of creatine\ndaily.  Athletes  in  the placebo  group  followed  the  same  protocol,  but  were  given  a  dextrose  solution.\nBefore and after 2 weeks of supplementation, 30 second-Wingate cycle ergometer test was conducted\non  judo  athletes.  In  creatine  group  the  improvements  in  peak  (12%  improvement)  and mean  power\n(10,8%  improvement)  were  2\u20133  times  higher  in  comparison  to  placebo  group  (4.4% and  5%\nrespectively)  [57].  The  most  common  dosing  protocol  is  creatine  loading.  During  the  first,  loading\nphase subjects ingest high doses of creatine (approximately 20 g of creatine or 0.3 g/kg per day) in 4\ndoses  for  5  days.  In  the  second,  maintenance  phase  athletes  are  given  smaller  amounts  of  creatine,\ngenerally 2\u20135 g daily (0.03 g/kg per day) for several weeks to months [42]. The average wash-out time\nof creatine in humans is 4 weeks. It has to be noticed that muscle PCr increase depends on the initial\nconcentration of muscle PCr. High muscle PCr concentration can be reached by eating high amounts of\ncreatine rich food such as meat and fish. The athletes with high initial concentration of PCr could not\nrespond   positively   to   creatine   supplementation   [58].   The   most   problematic   aspect   of   creatine\nsupplementation for combat sports athletes is a muscle water retention which leads to increasing body\nmass.  Athletes  who have to gain  weight limits for a competition may cease creatine supplementation\nfor approximately 4 weeks before weigh-in due to the average wash-out time.\nUsing supplements such as antioxidants may be beneficial due to alleviating oxidative stress and\ninflammation induced by training. Exercise induces enhanced production of reactive species leading to\nmodifications  of  lipids,  proteins  and  nucleic  acid,  decreased  muscular  functionality,  histological\nchanges and muscular soreness [59]. During prolonged and high-intensity exercises, the potential risk\nof free radical formation is more pronounced [60]. The study by Chun- Chung Chou [61] has shown,\n\n## 491\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\nthat  4-days\u2019 supplementation of 2000 mg vitamin C and 1400 IU vitamin E effectively attenuated\ninflammatory  response and  exercise-induced  tissue  damage  in  elite  taekwondo  athletes.  [61].  In\nanother study by Samaras et all [60], authors indicated that a 2 months\u2019 supplementation of a special\nprotein  bar  and  tomato  juice  significantly  improved  the  oxidative  status  in ultra-marathon  runners.\nNevertheless,  some  studies  have  shown  that  antioxidants  supplementation  may  potentially  blunt\nbeneficial  physiological  adaptations  induced  by  training  such  as  muscle  oxidative  capacity  and\nmitochondrial biogenesis [62,63].\n- Adverse effects of supplements\nUsing  supplements  can  be  connected  with  adverse  effects  that  can  affect  the  health  and  sports\ncareer of the athlete [64]. Supplements can be contaminated with unlisted or banned substances such\nas  anabolic  steroids  [65].  The  available data  suggests  that  almost  10\u201315%  of  supplements  may\ncontain  prohibited  substances  [66].  Despite  the  unintentional  injection  of  the  prohibited  substance,\nthe  athlete  may  be  banned  for  using  illegal  substances  and  loose  medals  and  records  set  [64].\nSubstances such as steroids are able to improve performance, increase the size of muscle fibers and\nmuscle  strength  [67].  Nevertheless,  a  variety  of  side  effects  can  occur  when  steroids  are  misused.\nThe  risk  of  using  steroids  include  health  outcomes  such  as  cardiomyopathy,  acne,  altered  serum\nlipids,  hepatotoxity  and  swollen  breast  tissues  in  men  [64,67].  Supplements  may  also  be  used  by\ninnappriopriate  patterns  that  can  lead  to  hypervitaminosis  or  problematic  interactions  between\ningredients.  [64].  The  study  by Tsarouhas  et  al.  has  shown  that  almost  86%  of  recreational  athletes\ndid not check the labelling of the chosen product before using it [65].\nA  special  group  of  food  supplements  are  available  as  preparation  for  weight  loss.  The  supposed\nmechanism  of  weight loss supplements  includes  an  impact  on  appetite  regulation,  carbohydrate\nabsorption, fat metabolism and energy expenditure regulation. According to current scientific knowledge,\nnone of the available, legal dietary supplements are supported by high-quality evidence [68]. The most\npopular,  evidence- based  preparation  for  weight  loss  is  ephedrine  which  has  been  prohibited  by  Food\nAnd  Drug  Administration  in  2004  [69].  The  study  by  Boozer  et.  all  has  shown  that  a  6-month\nsupplementation  with  90  mg of  ephedrine alkaloids combined  with  192 mg  of  caffeine  daily  promoted\nbody weight and fat reduction in comparision to the placebo group [70]. Despite the possitive effect on\nweight  reduction,  using  ephedrine  is  associated  with  high  risk  of  cardiovascular,  gastrointestinal and\npsyhiatric  symptoms  [71].  Another  potential  effect  of  using  supplements  for  reducing  weight  is\nhepatoxity.  The  supplements  including  garcinia  cambogia,  Herpalife  products,  green  tea  extract,  ma\nhuang, 1,3-Dimethylamylamine may  induce liver  injury [72\u201374].  In the study  by  Sticker et  al.,  authors\nindicated that consumption of Herbalife products may be connected with liver injury. The possible reason\nof  hepatoxic  potential  of  the  preparation  was  contamination  of  Bacillus  subtilis  [75].  Another  study  by\nTse- Ling  Fong  et  al.  as  shown  that  Hydroxycut  supplementation  may  a  cause  the  liver  injury,\nnevetheless  ingredients  in  the  preparation  responsible  for  causing  the  injury  remain  uncertain  and  the\nfurther research is required [76].\n- Reducing weight\nIn most combat sports, athletes are classified in weight divisions according to their body mass.\nMost athletes tend to reduce body weight in order to qualify for a lighter weight division so that they\n\n## 492\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\ncould  fight  with  lighter,  smaller  and  weaker  opponents  [77].  Weight  loss  may  be  achieved  through\nchronic strategies or rapid weight loss. Rapid weight loss includes the protocol when the body mass\nis achieved in a few days prior to weigh-in. Both strategies could impact on sports performance and\nprovide  negative  health  outcomes.  Chronic  weight  loss  is  mostly  associated  with  the  energy\ndeficiency  and  could  negatively  affect  on  immune  function,  metabolic  rate,  bone  health,  hormone\nprocess  and  lean  body  mass  [78,79].  Studies  have  shown  that  weight  cutting  may  influence\ntestosterone  level,  cortisol,  growth  hormone,  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  and  insulin.  The\ninfluence on hormone process can result in decreasing bone mineral density, adolescent development\nand  interfere  blood  glucose  regulation [1].  The  preferable  energy  deficiency  during  chronic  weight\nloss should consitute up to 20% of energy reqiurements [9]. Kordi et al. [80] have shown that gradual\nweight reduction is more than twice less common than rapid weight loss in the wrestlers community.\nNevertheless, gradual weight loss is more preferable [79]. If strictly necessary, rapid weight loss can\nbe the chosen way to reduce body mass but it shouldn\u2019t exceed 5% of body mass. Furthermore, it\nmay be reflected only if the time from weight-in to competition is sufficient to refeed and rehydrate\n(more than 3 hours) [3].\nThe most popular method of acute weight loss is an increase in exercise and restriction of fluid\nand food intake. To reduce weight, many athletes use dehydration protocol in order to remove excess\nwater  from  the  body  [81].  One  of  the  methods  of  reducing  total  body  water  is  fluid  restriction  in\nrelation to normal daily losses. Reduction of water in the body can be derived from extracellular and\nintracellular  stores  meaningly  free  and  bound  water  (in  glycogen stores  and  intestinal  space)  [79].\nThe  loss  of  the  body  water  is  induced  by  urination,  respiration  and  perspiration.  Urination,  as  the\nprimary  method  of  regulating  water  balance  is  controlled  by  the  renal system.  The  main  hormones\naffecting  fluid  regulation  are  aldosterone  and  antidiuretic  hormone-vasopressin  [82]. One  of  the\nmethods used by combat sports athletes to increase urine production is water loading. This technique\ninvolves the consumption of large fluid volume for several days prior to restriction. Reale at al. [81]\nhave  demonstrated that the  decrease of  body mass in the  water loading  group  was higher (3.2%) in\ncomparison to the control group (2.4%). The fluid intake in the water loading group was 100 ml/kg\nfor  3  days  in  comparison  to  40  ml/kg  in the control  group.  On  the  4\nth\nday  both  groups  were\nconsuming 15 ml/kg of fluids and were following the same rehydration protocols on 5\nth\nand 6\nth\ndays.\nMeasurements of urea and serum electrolytes didn\u2019t exceed reference levels in both groups. There\nwere no differences in physical performance between groups [81]. According to this protocol, water\nloading seems to be safe method of rapid weight loss in combat sports. In contrast to water loading,\nthere are many popular methods of dehydration amongst combat sports athletes affecting negatively\non health and sports performance. Many sportsmen in order to lose body mass use pharmacological\ndiuretics,  saunas,  hot  water  or  train  in  plastic  suits  which  lead  to  an  increase  in  serum  osmolality,\nbody heat storage and heart rate [79]. In the study by Amatori et al. 83] authors indicated that more\nsevere weight loss strategies including training in heat environment, hydric restriction, using plastic\nwear and saunas were practiced by professional fighters and high-level athletes.\nThe effects of dehydration can be enhanced by using a low sodium diet. It has been proved that a\nhigh  intake  of  sodium  leads  to  an  increase  of  fluid  retention.  Reducing  the  intake  of  sodium  several\ndays prior to weigh-in  may intensify weight loss [79]. Another effective method of losing weight in\ncombat  sports  is  glycogen  depletion [81]. Glycogen  is  a  branched  polymer  of  glucose  stored  in  the\nliver  and  skeletal  muscles  bound  to  water  in  proportion  of  1:3  g  (in  some  cases  this  ratio  could  be\nhigher) [84]. Glycogen storage can contribute 1\u20132% of skeletal muscle and up to 8% of liver weight.\n\n## 493\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\nOne  of  the  methods  leading  to  lower  glycogen  stores  is  a  low  carbohydrate  diet  connected  with  the\nnormal  training  program.  This  protocol  guides  to  glycogen  depletion  while  preventing  muscle\nglycogen  restoration.  Another  method  of  degrading  glycogen  reserves  is  performing  additional\nexercise in order to deplete glycogen stores more rapidly [8]. It has been proved that intake less than\n50 g of carbohydrates daily combined with a small reduction in energy in the fight week may facilitate\n1\u20132%  of  body  mass  loss  [79].  Furthermore,  it  has  to  be  noticed  that  decreased  levels  of  muscle\nglycogen  may  affect  negatively  on  isometric  strength,  power,  endurance  and  time  to  fatigue [85].\nNevertheless, the studies by Lambert et al. [86] have shown that low carbohydrate diet lasting 2 weeks\ndidn\u2019t impair the Wingate performance test. Similarly, Symons and Jacobs [87] reported that 2 days of\na low carbohydrate diet didn\u2019t result in any changes  in  strength  and  endurance  in  comparison  to the\nnormal  carbohydrate  intake. It  seems  to  be  crucial  to  replenish  depleted  glycogen  stores  as  soon  as\npossible  when  the  time  to  weigh-in  is  sufficient  [79]. Another  dietary  strategy  to  reduce  body  mass\nbefore competition is reduction of gut contents. In order to manipulate the intestinal contents without\ndecreasing sports performance athletes may reduce total food volume and fiber intake. Consumption\nof high-energy dense food with a low amount of fiber can increase body mass losses. It\u2019s proved that\nin comparison to high fiber diets, 2 days of low fiber intake helps to cleanse the bowel. Less than 10 g\nintake  of  fiber  daily  is  known  to  be  as  effective  as  a  way  to  reduce  body  weight  without  affecting\nperformance [79].\n## 9. Conclusions\nThe  appropriate  use  of  nutrition  can  enhance  sports  performance,  post-workout  regeneration  and\nimprove  body  composition  in  combat  sports  athletes. The  type,  as  well  as  the  time  of  macronutrient\nintake, may enhance muscle protein synthesis, recovery and tissue repair. The primary source of energy\nfor combat sports athletes should be carbohydrates in order to ensure the proper level of muscle glycogen,\nwhich is linked with higher ability to continue moderate and high-intensity trainings.\nThe positive effect  of  a  balanced  diet can  be  enhanced by sports  supplements.  There  are some\nsupplements which have a proven influence on strength, endurance and body composition in combat\nsports such as sodium bicarbonate, caffeine, creatine, beta-alanine or protein supplements.\nIn  most  combat  sports  athletes  tend  to  reduce  body  mass  in  order  to  obtain  classification  in  a\nlighter weight division. The most preferable way to reduce weight is gradual strategy of fat reduction\nincluding low energy deficiency. If necessary, another method of reduction that may be used is rapid\nweight loss. It has to be noticed that acute weight loss shouldn\u2019t exceed 5% of body mass. Otherwise,\nit could lead to serious health problems, for instance cardiovascular and endocrine system problems\nor even death. Both strategies of weight loss could decrease sports performance so it\u2019s necessary to\nuse safe, evidence-based protocols in order to minimize negative health outcomes. In order to lower\nthe  health  problems  and  maximise  sport potential,  each  athlete  should  be  placed  under  a  medical\nteam including doctors and nutritionists. Furthermore, it\u2019s crucial to educate athletes about proper\nnutrition and weight loss in combat sports.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n## 494\nAIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485\u2013498.\n## References\n- Barley OR, Chapman DW, Guppy SN, et al.

Furthermore, athletes should\nevaluate and refine their weight-making and recovery practices from competition to competition.\n## INTRODUCTION\nIn most combat sports, competitors are separated into weight divisions\nin  an  attempt  to  \u201ccreate  an  even  playing  field.\u201d  Prior  to  competition,\nathletes  must  attend  an  official  \u201cweigh-in\u201d  and  have  their  body  mass\n(BM)  verified  to  ensure  they  have  \u201cmade  weight.\u201d  The  period  of  time\nbetween  weigh-in  and  competition  differs  between  combat  sports;\nhowever, a recovery period of at least 3 and up to 24 h exists among\nthe Olympic combat sports and an even greater time (> 30 h) may be\navailable  in  professional  combat  sports.  Most  fighters  try  to  take\nadvantage of this scenario by using acute weight loss (AWL) strategies\n(cutting  weight)  in  the  hours  and  days  before  weigh-in,  temporarily\nlowering their BM to make weight at a lower division than their day-to-\nday  weight  (and  thus  compete  against  smaller  opponents).  Athletes\nthen  attempt  to  reverse  the  negative  performance  effects  of  AWL\nduring  the  recovery  period  (Franchini  et  al.,  2012).  Indeed,  there  is\nindirect  evidence  indicating  AWL  increases  success  in  some  combat\nsports  (Franchini  et  al.,  2012;  Reale  et  al.,  2017a).  Thus  if  sensibly\nimplemented,  and  adequate  post  weigh-in  recovery  opportunities\nexist,  cutting  weight  might  be  seen  as  a  pragmatic  way  to  optimize\ncompetitiveness.\nIt needs to be stated that severe health consequences (including death\n[Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  1998])  may  arise  from\nextreme and excessive AWL. Thus, the magnitude and methods of AWL\nneed to be managed in such a way as to minimize potential negative\nconsequences.  Although  some  have  called  for  the  abolishment  of\nweight   cutting,   until   such   time   that   regulations   specifically   and\nsystematically prohibit the practice, it appears athletes will continue to\ncut   weight.   Therefore,   sports   nutrition   professionals   need   to\npragmatically  balance  athletes\u2019  desires  to  achieve  (real  or  perceived)\nadvantages  with  concerns  for  their  physical,  mental  and  emotional\nsafety.  This  means  advising  against  excessively  large  magnitudes  of\nweight loss and educating both athletes and coaches to make use of\nless  harmful,  evidenced-based  methods  of  weight  loss,  as  well  as\noptimizing recovery.\n## ACHIEVABLE MAGNITUDES OF SAFE ACUTE\n## WEIGHT LOSS\nCombat sport athletes commonly lose \u2265 5% BM in the week prior to\nweigh-in (Franchini et al., 2012). Under some conditions, achieving 5%\nand up to 8% BM losses alongside acceptably small impacts on health\nand performance may be possible (Reale et al., 2016, 2017a). However,\nan  appreciation  of  optimized  methods  of  AWL,  as  well  as  a  realistic\nassessment of one\u2019s \u201cstarting point\u201d prior to AWL is required. Utilizing\nsolely  dehydration  to  achieve  5-8%  BM  loss  is  inadvisable  and\ndangerous to health. Instead, a calculated manipulation of gut content,\ncarbohydrate stores and finally body water should be utilized in order to\nachieve  the  desired  AWL.  Therefore,  the  starting  point  prior  to  AWL\nshould  represent  a  BM  associated  with  a  euhydrated,  well-nourished\nstate,  which  allows  an  opportunity  for  sizeable  manipulation  of  these\ncompartments.  Lastly,  the  recovery  time  available  post  weigh-in/pre-\ncompetition will further determine the magnitude of AWL achievable if\none wants to present to competition in an acceptable state. As a guide,\nwith greater than 12 h between weigh-in and competition (e.g., sports\nwhich conduct weigh-ins the day before competition), a fully hydrated,\nwell-nourished athlete may lose and recover from up to 8% BM (Reale\net  al.,  2016).  Those  weighing-in  the  morning  of  competition  (with\nlimited recovery time, e.g. \u2264\n## ~\n6 h) should aim for no more than 5% BM\nacute losses (Reale et al., 2016).\n## S\nports Science Exchange (2018) Vol. 31, No. 183, 1-6\n## 1\n\n## METHODS TO ACHIEVE SAFE ACUTE WEIGHT LOSS\nManipulation of Gut Content\nCombat sport athletes commonly fast, limit portion sizes or reduce total\nfood volume prior to weigh-in to reduce the mass of intestinal contents\nand  thus  total  BM  (Brito  et  al.,  2012;  Fleming  &  Costarelli,  2007;\nFranchini et al., 2012). Laxative and bowel preparation formula use is\ncommon  among  weight  category  sport  athletes  (Brito  et  al.,  2012;\nFranchini  et  al.,  2012).  While  this  method  is  effective  in  removing\nintestinal bulk and cleansing the bowel, this will also impact energy and\nmacronutrient  intake/absorption,  and  has  been  shown  to  reduce\nexercise  capacity  (Holte  et  al.,  2004).  Therefore,  dietary  strategies\nwhich   reduce   total   food   volume   without   impacting   energy   and\nmacronutrient intake (i.e., the consumption of low weight, energy dense\nfoods  in  the  hours  and  days  prior  to  weigh-in)  are  preferable.  This  is\nespecially  true  for  athletes  who  have  limited  time  to  effectively\nrehydrate and refuel prior to competition (due to limited recovery time\npost weigh-in).\nCertain types of dietary fiber can both slow gut transit times of foods as\nwell as draw water into the intestinal space, \u201cbulking\u201d stools. Different\nfoods possess different fecal bulking properties (Monro, 2000), thus if\none reduces the consumption of \u201cbulking\u201d fiber-rich foods, a reduction\nof  undigested  plant  matter  within  the  gut  and  a  reduction  in  water\ndrawn into the intestinal space follows. This decreases fecal bulk, total\ngut contents and overall BM. In fact, a linear relationship exists between\nfiber intake and bowel cleanliness. The consumption of a low fiber diet\nfor  just  two  days  begins  cleansing  the  bowel  (Wu  et  al.,  2011),  with\nseven  days  being  as  effective  as  a  bowel  preparation  formula,  while\nresulting  in  less  physiological  stress  than  bowel  preparation  formulas\n(Lijoi et al., 2009).\nLimited research examining low fiber diets in the context of AWL exists,\nand  whole  gut  transit  times  vary  widely  between  individuals  from\n10-96 h (Lee et al., 2014). Therefore, precise guidelines for the use of\nfiber  restriction  for  AWL  cannot  presently  be  determined.  However,\nindirect evidence suggests significant weight loss (\n## ~\n1.5% BM), in line\nwith that following bowel preparation formula use (Holte et al., 2004),\nis achieved following 48 h of fiber restriction (\u2264 10 g/d), with no further\nsignificant losses in most individuals (Reale et al., 2017b). Thus, 48 h\nseems a sensible starting point to implement this approach, noting that\nindividual responses may vary and some individuals may benefit from a\nrestriction > 48 h.\nManipulation of Glycogen Content\nDietary  carbohydrate  is  stored  in  skeletal  muscle  and  the  liver  as\nglycogen  and  these  energy  reserves  can  be  mobilized  to  meet  the\ndemand  for  glucose.  Glycogen  is  noted  to  bind  to  water  at  a  ratio  of\n1:2.7  (Bergstr\u00f6m  &  Hultman,  1972).  Given  the  substantial  glycogen\nstorage capacity of athletes, and the ability to manipulate these stores\n(Burke & Deakin, 2009), this represents another AWL strategy available\nto  the  weight  category  sport  athlete.  Both  the  restriction  of  dietary\ncarbohydrate  coupled  with  glycogen  demanding  training,  and  the\nincrease  of  training  alongside  one\u2019s  habitual  carbohydrate  intake,  will\nresult  in  changes  in  glycogen  status.  Prior  to  weigh-in/competition,\nathletes tend to decrease (not increase) training, and therefore reducing\n(or   restricting   altogether)   carbohydrate   intake   without   increasing\ntraining in order to deplete glycogen stores would be a logical strategy.\nIt  has  been  shown  that  7  d  of  a  low  carbohydrate  diet  (<  50  g/d),\ncombined with training and a minor energy deficit (< 10%) can achieve\na ~2% BM reduction while maintaining strength, power and anaerobic\ncapacity measures (Sawyer et al., 2013). However, the exact magnitude\nof possible BM loss, the degree of carbohydrate restriction and the time\nframe required, will depend on one\u2019s glycogen status and training load\nprior to dietary restriction. A general recommendation of < 50 g/d for\n3-7  d  for  combat  sport  athletes  wanting  to  deplete  glycogen  prior  to\nweigh-in  has  been  suggested  (Reale  et  al.,  2016).  Athletes  should\nconsider the time available post weigh-in to refuel and the requirements\nof  their  sport  (i.e.,  fuel  demands,  need  for  repeated  weigh-ins,  etc.)\nwhen deciding whether to utilize glycogen depletion (and to what extent)\nas a means to achieve AWL.\nManipulation of Body Water\nWater constitutes ~60% of the human body (Sawka et al., 2005) in the\ngeneral population and likely more in athletes due to higher amounts of\nlean mass. Given the size of this body compartment and the short time\nframe in which fluctuations can occur, it is no surprise that dehydration\nis  the  primary  AWL  strategy  used  by  many  combat  sport  athletes.\nAlthough  mild  dehydration  (<  2%  BM)  is  unlikely  to  affect  relevant\nperformance, larger magnitudes may be problematic, particularly when\nlimited time to rehydrate post weigh-in exists (Reale, 2016, 2017a). Put\nsimply, athletes have two methods available to them to decrease body\nwater;  consume  less  fluid  and/or  excrete  more  fluid.  A  24  h  fluid\nrestriction (< 300 ml (10 oz)) may result in 1.5-2% BM loss (James &\nShirreffs,  2013);  however,  athletes  commonly  achieve  losses  greater\nthan this following increased sweating via both active (exercise induced)\nand/or  passive  methods  (i.e.,  saunas,  heated  environments,  etc.)\n(Franchini et al., 2012).\nIt is important to note the differing physiological responses of passive\nand  active  sweating.  Passive  sweating  prior  to  exercise  decreases\nplasma volume, sweat rate and stroke volume, contributing to increased\nserum  osmolality,  heart  rate  and  body  heat  storage,  whereas  this\nhappens  to  a  lesser  extent  following  active  sweating  (Walsh  et  al.,\n1994). Therefore, a combination of fluid restriction and active sweating\n(preferably accompanying existing training sessions in the hours or day\nprior to weigh-in) may be the most pragmatic, performance preserving\nmethod  to  achieve  AWL  via  dehydration.  Additional  passive  sweating\nshould only be used when necessary and when sufficient recovery time\nis available. If using a sauna to facilitate perspiration, dry heat should be\nused  in  preference  to  steam  saunas,  as  this  results  in  greater  fluid\nlosses for a given period of time and less physiological strain (Pilch et\nal., 2014).\n## S\nports Science Exchange (2018) Vol. 31, No. 183, 1-6\n## 2\n\nLastly, reductions in sodium intake may also result in body water losses,\nresulting  from  renal  attempts  to  maintain  osmotic  pressure,  achieved\nthrough the excretion and retention of both electrolytes and fluid. BM\nlosses  of  1-2%  have  been  reported  in  hypertensive  subjects  who\nswitched to a low sodium (< 500 mg) diet for 5 days (He et al., 2001);\nhowever, no interim BM measures were taken, so it is not possible to\nstate the exact time frame of weight loss. Furthermore, whether or not\nsimilar  losses  would  occur  in  normotensive  subjects  is  unknown.\nDespite  the  lack  of  definitive  evidence,  reductions  in  sodium  intake\nduring  AWL  are  common  (Fleming  &  Costarelli,  2007),  and  perhaps\neven if a reduction in sodium intake may not influence total body water\nper  se,  when  used  in  combination  with  other  fluid  manipulation\nstrategies  it  may  \u201crelease\u201d  more  body  water  and  allow  a  reduction  in\nBM (Reale et al., 2016).\n## POST WEIGH-IN RECOVERY NUTRITION\nAny advantage gained from cutting weight leading into competition will\nbe  best  maximized  by  enacting  a  calculated  recovery  plan  following\nweigh-in. Priorities following weigh-in may include rehydration, glycogen\nrestoration and the management of gastrointestinal distress.\n## Rehydration\nCombat sport athletes should aim to restore fluid losses to within ~2%\nof \u201cpre-hypohydration\u201d BM in order to minimize negative performance\neffects (Burke & Deakin, 2009; Walsh et al., 1994). Factors which may\nprohibit  the  attainment  of  this  goal  include  insufficient  recovery  time\nand difficulty in accurately identifying the magnitude of hypohydration,\nsince acute changes in BM (traditionally thought to mirror fluid losses)\nwill likely be made up of more than solely body water. Adequate recovery\ntime following weigh-ins conducted the day before competition is likely;\nhowever, this may not be the case for those weighing-in the morning of\ncompetition. Therefore, those who weigh-in the morning of competition\nmay  best  manage  BM  by  preventing  the  need  to  lose  >  3%  BM  via\ndehydration in order to make weight (Reale et al., 2016, 2017a).\nGeneral  sports  nutrition  recommendations  suggest  125-150%  of  any\nfluid  deficit  needs  to  be  ingested  to  compensate  for  continued  urine\nlosses (Shirreffs & Maughan, 1998; Maughan & Leiper, 1999; Burke &\nDeakin, 2009). In certain situations, this may be difficult to implement\nsince the true fluid deficit may be unknown (e.g., \u201cnon-fluid\u201d AWL may\nconfound the typical use of BM changes in estimating hypohydration)\nand large fluid volumes may be impractical to consume during limited\nrecovery time. In addition to fluid volumes larger than losses, athletes\ncan  further  enhance  rehydration  efforts  post  weigh-in  via  additional\nstrategies.\nConsuming a large fluid bolus ~600-900 mL (20-30 oz) immediately\npost  weigh-in  as  well  as  additional  boluses  at  regular  intervals  will\nmaintain a high gastric volume, in turn speeding gastric emptying and\npotentially preventing the need to consume fluids closer to competition\n(Maughan & Leiper, 1999).\nSweat losses are comprised of not only fluid but electrolytes, primarily\nsodium and chloride (Maughan & Leiper, 1999). Thus, replacement of\nthese  electrolytes  will  promote  restoration  of  plasma  osmolality  and\nvolume.  Sweat  sodium  concentrations  range  from  ~20-80  mmol/L\n(Shirreffs & Maughan, 1998; Maughan & Leiper, 1999, Burke & Deakin,\n2009),  making  it  difficult  to  prescribe  one  \u201coptimal\u201d  sodium  con-\ncentration  for  a  rehydration  beverage.  However,  fluid  retention  does\ncorrelate with sodium content due to both electrolyte replacement and\nthe  effects  on  intestinal  absorption  (Maughan  &  Leiper,  1999).  This\noccurs following both the consumption of salty foods alongside fluids\n(Ray  et  al.,  1998)  and  sodium  containing  fluids  alone.  Sports  drinks\ntypically  contain  <  30  mmol/L  sodium,  whereas  oral  rehydration\nsolutions (ORS), commonly used in the treatment of acute diarrhea or\nvomiting  contain  50-90  mmol/L  sodium  (Maughan  &  Leiper,  1999;\nBurke, 2009). Thus, consuming beverages with additional sodium may\nbe  the  best  option  when  rehydration  is  the  priority.  Alternatively,\nconsuming salty snacks alongside sports drinks will increase the total\nsodium load ingested, thereby increasing fluid retention. In this scenario,\nconsideration  needs  to  be  given  to  the  fact  that  increased  energy\nderived from any food consumed concurrent to a sports drink will slow\ngastric  emptying  (Maughan  et  al.,  1996).  Lastly,  fluid  restriction  (as\nopposed  to  dehydration  following  sweating)  causes  a  decrease  in  net\nbody  water  without  the  same  electrolyte  losses  (James  &  Shirreffs,\n2013).  Therefore,  electrolyte  replacement  is  less  important  in  this\nsituation and lower sodium fluids will be well retained.\n## Glycogen Restoration\nFully  saturated  glycogen  stores  may  not  be  required  for  optimal\nperformance in combat sports; however, incomplete glycogen depletion\nimpaired anaerobic exercise lasting ~5 min, and performance improve-\nments following glycogen-loading in predominantly anaerobically fueled\nscenarios have also been noted (Pizza et al., 1995). Furthermore, BM\ngain  (a  consequence  of  glycogen  loading)  (Sawyer  et  al.,  2013)  may\nindirectly increase competitive success (Franchini et al., 2012; Reale et\nal., 2017a). Therefore, post weigh-in recovery nutrition should include\nenough carbohydrate to at least provide adequate fuel for competition\nneeds,  and  potentially  maximize  glycogen  stores  (if  time  permits  and\nintake  does  not  interfere  with  rehydration  or  gastrointestinal  (GI)\ncomfort).\nGeneral  sports  nutrition  guidelines  prescribe  carbohydrate  intakes  of\n5-7  g\n## .\nkg\n## -1.\nd\n## -1\nfor athletes engaged in moderate volume training and up\nto 7-10 g\n## .\nkg\n## -1.\nd\n## -1\nto maximize glycogen storage (Burke & Deakin, 2009;\nBurke  et  al.,  2017).  Taking  into  consideration  tapered  training  and\nallowing   for   potential   carbohydrate   loading,   a   post   weigh-in\nrecommendation  of  5-10  g/kg  BM  encompasses  both  goals.  Those\nwith  limited  recovery  time  and/or  those  wanting  to  avoid  potential  GI\ndiscomfort may want to aim for the lower end of this range, whereas\nathletes with extended recovery times and/or the desire to increase BM\nwould likely benefit from consuming at the higher end. Selecting high\nglycemic  index  carbohydrate  and/or  carbohydrate-rich  fluids  (which\n## S\nports Science Exchange (2018) Vol. 31, No. 183, 1-6\n## 3\n\nsimultaneously  aide  in  rehydration  efforts)  may  reduce  GI  discomfort\ncommonly  associated  with  the  consumption  of  solid  foods  close  to\ncompetition  (Burke  &  Deakin,  2009;  Reale  et  al.,  2017a).  Adding\nprotein to recovery meals/snacks may increase glycogen storage when\ncarbohydrate intake is sub-optimal (Ivy et al., 2002; Burke et al., 2017).\nConsideration needs to be given to rehydration however, as hypertonic\nfluids (e.g., fluids > 10% carbohydrate) may decrease the rate of gastric\nemptying  and  rehydration,  as  well  as  affect  GI  comfort  (Evans  et  al.,\n2009). Therefore, at times, athletes may need to determine which takes\npriority between rehydration and refueling, as focusing on one may limit\ntheir ability to achieve the other.\n## Managing Gastrointestinal Distress\nIdeally, post weigh-in intake should fully recover nutritional status while\navoiding GI distress. Of the aforementioned AWL strategies, a low fiber\ndiet is likely the least harmful (Reale et al., 2016). In contrast to depleted\nglycogen  and  dehydration,  reduced  GI  bulk  is  not  thought  to  be\nperformance limiting, providing energy intake is adequate (Reale et al.,\n2016). Thus, BM loss by reducing gut contents does not require acute\nreplacement,  and  recovery  should  focus  on  replacement  of  fluid  and\ncarbohydrate as dictated by acute losses. In fact, a sudden reintroduction\nof   dietary   fiber   slows   gastric   emptying   and   nutrient   absorption\n(Hillemeier,  1995),  potentially  producing  GI  discomfort  (Mahan  &\nEscott-Stump, 2008). The same occurs with large fat intakes (Mahan\n& Escott-Stump, 2008). Thus, dietary fiber and fat should be limited as\nconsumption  post  weigh-in  not  only  displaces  other  more  important\nnutrients   but   may   impair   competition   performance   directly   and\nindirectly.  This  consideration  is  heightened  when  the  recovery  period\nis limited.\nSome athletes that are worried about GI distress (potentially worsened\nby gut contact during competition), may feel unable to consume solid\nfoods  or  even  energy  containing  fluids  pre-event.  For  these  (and  all)\nathletes,  there  are  options  which  may  enhance  performance  without\naggravating GI symptoms. Both caffeine use, and \u201cmouth rinsing\u201d and\nspitting  of  a  carbohydrate  based  solution  or  food  is  known  to  aide\nperformance  during  times  of  low  carbohydrate  availability  (Kasper  et\nal., 2016).\nBecoming  familiar  with  individual  responses  to  caffeine  is  important;\nhowever,  in  general,  the  dose  response  relationship  with  caffeine\nfollows a U-shaped curve. That is; mild to moderate doses (3-6 mg/kg)\nconsumed 60 min pre-exercise elicits desirable effects, and increasing\ndoses cause over stimulation, anxiety and potential decrements in fine\nmotor control (Burke & Deakin, 2009).\nAlthough no specific combat sports data exists, based on the current\nliterature in comparable as well as wider scenarios, rinsing the mouth\nfor ~10 s with a sports drink (or other carbohydrate solution or food)\npre-competition may enhance performance (Burke & Maughan, 2015;\nKasper  et  al.,  2016).  This  represents  a  low  risk  strategy  potentially\nproviding increased drive, due to the activation of regions or responses\nin the central nervous system which may increase corticomotor activity\nand/or reduce perception of effort, at a time when athletes may want to\navoid swallowing foods or fluids (Burke & Maughan, 2015).\n## PRE-COMPETITION NUTRITION\nIn  most  sports,  pre-competition  nutrition  involves  a  \u201cfine  tuning\u201d  of\nnutritional  status  alongside  the  pursuit  of  comfort,  routine  and  ritual\npractices and not the aggressive reversal of weight-making efforts. This\nrepresents another challenge for the combat sport athlete. Ideally, full\nrecovery  of  nutritional  status  (following  AWL)  will  occur  several  hours\nbefore   competition,   allowing   one   to   focus   on   \u201ctraditional\u201d   pre-\ncompetition practices. When there is limited recovery time post weigh-\nin  or  when  excessive  AWL  has  occurred,  incorporating  these  two\nthemes can be challenging. Consequently, the shorter the time interval\nbetween  weigh-in  and  competition,  the  less  weight  an  athlete  should\nattempt to lose/gain acutely.\nIncreased  carbohydrate  availability  in  the  hours  prior  to  exercise  is  a\nwell-recognized strategy to improve performance across multiple sports\n(Lambert  et  al.,  1991,  Burke  &  Deakin,  2009).  Determining  specific\npre-fight  meal  prescriptions  is  challenging  at  this  stage;  however,\ncarbohydrate intakes \u2265 1g/kg in the hours before exercise are noted to\nassist repeated high intensity efforts (Lambert et al., 1991). Although\nathletes\u2019  individual  preferences  must  be  considered,  easily  digested,\nlow-fat,  low-fiber  carbohydrate-rich  foods  before  and  between  bouts\nwould seem ideal (Reale et al., 2017a, Burke & Deakin, 2009).\n## MANAGING POST WEIGH-IN RECOVERY, GUT COMFORT\n## AND COMPETITION NUTRITION CONCURRENTLY\nPost weigh-in, there is a \u201ccrossover\u201d time point where nutrition priorities\nchange from recovery to competition (nutritional, mental and physical)\npreparation.  For  athletes  who  weigh-in  the  day  prior  to  competition,\nachieving recovery goals prior to sleep makes sense, thus permitting a\nfocus on competition preparation upon waking. For athletes weighing in\non the morning of competition, isolating this crossover point is harder\nand is likely dictated predominantly by a desire to avoid gut discomfort\nand other anxieties surrounding the pre-competition period.\nAssessment  of  recovery  requirements  and  preparation  of/access  to\nappropriate fluids and foods should take place ahead of time, allowing\nrecovery to begin immediately post weigh-in. There may be a conflict\nbetween  rehydration  goals  where  lower  osmolality/energy  beverages\nenhance   gastric   emptying   and   nutrient   restoration   goals   where\naggressive carbohydrate replenishment may slow gastric emptying. In\nthis situation, athletes may need to make specific decisions regarding\nnutrition  priorities.  Fighters  commonly  select  fluids  in  the  period\nimmediately (30-60 min) post-weigh-in, thus ingestion of an ORS (or a\nhigh sodium containing sports drink) may be a suitable choice for those\nprioritizing rehydration, whereas traditional sports drinks, gels, chews\nand  candy  or  other  high  glycemic  index  foods  that  are  portable  and\neasily digested carbohydrate sources provide a post weigh-in solution\n## S\nports Science Exchange (2018) Vol. 31, No. 183, 1-6\n## 4\n\ntargeted  toward  fueling.  Further,  liquid  boluses  aimed  to  maximize\ngastric volume/emptying could include sweetened milk to provide pro-\ntein  and  carbohydrate  simultaneously  and  thus  address  additional\nnutrition goals, but again decisions may need to be made regarding the\nimportance of recovering fluid vs. carbohydrate/energy.\nIn the second hour of recovery, athletes may wish to begin solid food\nconsumption. Carbohydrate-rich, low fiber, low fat selections will best\npromote  glycogen  storage  while  lessening  potential  GI  discomfort.\nContinuing fluid intake during this time is also important, but if water is\nconsumed  alongside  sodium-rich  foods,  electrolyte-containing  bever-\nages  may  not  be  required  (Maughan  et  al.,  1996).  In  reality,  many\ncommon foods are either high in sodium and/or easy to add salt to, and\nare suitable as recovery meals (Ray et al., 1998). When controlling food\ncomposition is difficult and/or an athlete does not want to/or cannot eat\na larger meal, continuing to drink an ORS to address hydration alongside\nsugar-rich  snacks  or  sports  foods  will  address  carbohydrate  requir-\nements. Similarly, many sports drinks are convenient choices for mod-\nerate rates of rehydration and refueling. However, some have lower than\noptimal sodium contents for facilitating rapid rehydration, so consuming\nsalty snacks concurrently will further support fluid retention. Proactive\nstrategies  addressing  rehydration  and  glycogen  replenishment  should\ncontinue until recovery is achieved (e.g., consumption of 125-150% of\nfluid deficit and adequate carbohydrate) or until continued consumption\ncauses GI distress or interferes with competition preparation.\n## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS AND SUMMARY\nWeight cutting in combat sports is a contentious issue. It may indirectly\nincrease  competitive  success  while  concurrently  decreasing  absolute\nperformance  and  presenting  a  health  risk.  Athletes  should  familiarize\nthemselves with the associated risks and the evidenced based methods\nto manage them. Avoiding extreme magnitudes of acute weight (and in\nparticular body water) fluctuations will best preserve performance and\nhealth. Table 1 summarizes key pre and post weigh-in nutrition recom-\nmendations,  but  it  must  be  noted  that  exact  requirements  will  vary\nbased  on  magnitude  of  weight  loss  required,  recovery  time  frame\navailable post weigh-in, and requirements of the sport. Combat sport\nathletes  are  advised  to  develop  a  plan  that  includes  well-practiced\nroutines,  as  well  as  continually  evaluating  and  refining  AWL  and\nrecovery processes throughout their career. For further detailed recom-\nmendations, readers are directed to existing acute weight loss (Reale et\nal., 2016) and recovery/pre-competition (Reale et al., 2017a) reviews.\n## REFERENCES\nBergstr\u00f6m,  J.,  and  E.
