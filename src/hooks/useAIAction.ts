/**
 * Drop-in replacement for `useAction(...)` on Convex AI actions that are
 * pro-gated server-side. Every gated AI action call site should use this
 * hook instead of `useAction` directly so:
 *
 *   1. A stale Convex `profile.subscription*` row doesn't manifest as a
 *      user-visible `PRO_FEATURE_REQUIRED` for paying pro customers.
 *   2. (Optional) Free users get an upfront paywall before the action is
 *      ever dispatched — no token round-trip, no error toast.
 *
 * Behaviour matches `useAction` exactly on the happy path. On a thrown
 * `PRO_FEATURE_REQUIRED:*` error, the returned function:
 *   1. Reads `customerInfo` from the RC SDK.
 *   2. If RC confirms pro, calls `api.actions.activatePremium` so Convex
 *      catches up to the real entitlement window.
 *   3. Refreshes the reactive profile query.
 *   4. Retries the original action exactly once. If it throws again, the
 *      error propagates so the UI's normal paywall path runs.
 *
 * Optional `featureKey` second arg enables the upfront client gate: when
 * the current tier doesn't meet the feature's `minTier`, the returned
 * function opens the paywall and rejects with the same error shape the
 * server would have thrown — so caller `.catch` blocks behave identically
 * regardless of which side rejected.
