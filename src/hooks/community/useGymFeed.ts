/**
 * Paginated gym feed reader for the Corner (Community) page.
 *
 * Wraps Convex's `usePaginatedQuery` against `api.gymFeed.listFeed` and
 * surfaces a normalised `{ results, status, loadMore }` triple that the
 * polaroid stack consumes. The hook is intentionally thin — server-side
 * privacy filtering, author-dedupe, and thumb hydration all live in the
 * existing Convex query, so this layer only:
 *
 *   1. Defers the query until `gymId` resolves (so cold-launch doesn't
 *      fire a request before the user's primary gym is known).
 *   2. Caps `loadMore` at 8 docs per page (the polaroid stack only ever
 *      shows the top 3 cards — fetching 12 fresh rows at a time is more
 *      than enough headroom while keeping doc-read counts low).
 *
 * Why not cache via `AIPersistence`? The feed is reactive — every like /
 * comment / new post that lands on the gym pushes a fresh snapshot down
 * the websocket. Caching a stale page would force a manual invalidate
 * step on every mutation. Convex's own subscription is already faster
 * and cheaper than disk I/O for this access pattern.
