#### Abstract

#### Weight-categorysports are defined by the requirementofaweigh-in before

#### competitiontoprovideperformanceequityandreducedinjuryrisksbyelim-

#### inating size discrepancies. Athletes in these sports try to gain a theoretical

#### advantage by competing in weight divisions that are lower than their day-

#### to-day body mass (BM), using a combination of chronic strategies (body-

#### fat losses) and acute manipulations over a period of hours to days before

#### weigh-in (“making weight”). Strategies to support safer practices include

#### minimal competition weight classification based on preseason body compo-

#### sition, reductions in the period between weigh-in and competition, and

#### prohibition of unhealthy weight loss techniques. At an individual level,

#### expert guidance by a sports nutrition professional can help an athlete to

#### establish a pragmatic and long-term approach to BM management, recog-

#### nizing the nuances of their sport, to achieve favorable outcomes for both

#### health and performance.

### Introduction

### A number of sports involve competition in weight categories

### or divisions (hereafter called weight categories), with the main

### aimofcreatinganevenplayingfieldandsafercompetitionby

### matching competitors with similar physical characteristics (1).

### The sports include combat (e.g.,boxing,

### martial and mixed martial arts [MMA],

### wrestling), weightlifting, powerlifting, sprint

### football, and rowing. An exception is in

### horse racing, where the weight restric-

### tion on the jockey provides a handicap

### to the performance of the horse. The

### prevailing culture in such sports is a de-

### sire to compete in a category that is lower

### than their natural or day-to-day training

### body mass (BM), to gain a real or perceived

### advantage over lighter opponent(s) (2–4).

### Concerns over health risks and the fair-

### ness of competition underpin the efforts

### of many weight-category sports to enact

### rule changes and education programs, in

### the hope of reducing the prevalence and

### magnitude of BM manipulation activities (5,6). It may seem

### convenient to consider weight-category sports as a collective

### because of their common need to achieve a specified BM prior

### to competition. However, recent research has highlighted the

### specificity and nuances of BM manipulation practices within

### each sport and the need for practitioners to support pragmatic

### strategies for management of BM around competition to opti-

### mize performance while safeguarding health (2–4). This con-

### sensus statement provides a summary of factors that should

### be considered and replaces the 1996 ACSM Position stand

### on Weight Loss in Wrestlers (7).

### Characteristics across Different Weight-Category Sports

### That Influence Weight-Making Practices

### In weight-category sports, athletes have their BM verified

### at an official“weigh-in”prior to competition to ensure they

### meet the specified weight requirements.“Making”or“cutting”

### weight (hereafter called making weight) involves a range of acute

### and/or chronically applied strategies. The perceived or actual

### benefits of competing in a lower weight category vary between

### sports according to the characteristics that determine success

### (4,6,8). Although there are some common weight-making prac-

### tices across all weight category sports, specific protocols are often

### determined by the rules, customs, and characteristics that influ-

### ence opportunities to acutely reduce BM prior to the weigh-in,

### and subsequently recover from this in the period between

### weigh-in and competition. Table 1 summarizes some of the

### features of weight-category sports, with brief comments about

### how these characteristics may influence weight-making prac-

### tices. Since rule changes can occur in these sports, this infor-

### mation is provided principally to illustrate how various

### characteristics can influence weight-making per se, or its effect

### on health and performance.

### Key issues influencing weight-making practices include the

### number of weight categories available for competition, and

### the frequency with which the athlete needs to make weight

### (e.g., frequency of competition and the number of times the

### athlete must weigh in over the course of an event). While an

### increased number of weight categories may provide more op-

### portunities for an athlete to find a class that is best suited to

### their natural physique, the smaller weight increments between

### divisions also may create greater temptation to“cut”to a

### lower division. Sports that provide greater challenges include

### those with few divisions (e.g., lightweight rowing), and those

### in which the weight categories vary according to the compe-

### tition. For example, in many combat sports, there are fewer

### or different weight categories on the Olympic Games pro-

### gram than on other national or international competitions

### (see Table 1). Sports involving weekly competition (e.g., horse

### racing and collegiate wrestling during the competitive season)

### require frequent perturbations in BM, whereas in others (e.g.,

### professional boxing or lightweight rowing), the athlete may

### only compete“at weight”a couple of times a year. For further

### insight into characteristics that shape weight making practices

### of athletes in weight category sports, the reader is referred to

### the following references: (2–4,22).

### The timeframe between weigh-in and competition varies

### between sports, affecting the ability of the athlete to recover

### from any weight-making strategies. Horse racing represents

### the greatest challenge since successful jockeys must reweigh af-

### ter the race, minimizing their opportunities to consume food

### or fluid before competition (23). At the other end of the spec-

### trum, some sports (e.g., professional boxing and MMA) offer

### substantial recovery time (up to 32 h) between the weigh-in

### and event, with almost unlimited opportunities for preevent

### fluid and food intake. While such sports allow the athlete to

### be well-fueled and hydrated prior to competition, these condi-

### tions support a culture of extreme BM manipulation (24), as

### evidenced by mean BM gain of up 10% and individual values

### of 20% BM gain during the recovery period (25–28). Indeed,

### there may be a link between the amount of postweigh-in rapid

### weight gain (RWG) and the duration of the recovery period

### (4,29). Some sports (e.g., judo and taekwondo) have tried to

### circumvent this by introducing a second weigh-in on the

### morning of the event for randomly selected competitors, with

### rules prohibiting a BM gain >5% from initial weigh-in. Other

### sports (e.g., lightweight rowing, Olympic boxing) routinely

### implement a pretournament weigh-in plus repeat weight checks

### in the hours prior to any subsequent event in which the athlete

### competes. Unfortunately, there are anecdotal observations that

### such changes merely encourage the athlete to limit their recovery,

### rather than curtail the magnitude of the weight-making (30).

### Although cultural beliefs and traditions underpin the weight

### making practices observed in many sports (3,4,22,24,31), char-

### acteristics of performance also may influence the degree to which

### they persist, because of the advantages of having a greater“true”

### BM. In sports like rowing, there are significant advantages to

### having greater muscle mass/power and longer limb“levers”

### (32). Indeed, despite the considerable physiological stress of

### a race, often overlaid with thermal stress, and even though

### the rules of competition try to limit weight-making by imple-

### menting serial weigh-ins close to the time of competition, it

### appears that successful lightweight rowers do not“naturally”

### fit below their weight targets (31). Furthermore, there is evi-

### dence that lightweight rowers can preserve performance via

### planned nutrition support around some degree of weight mak-

### ing (31,33,34). On the other hand, a recent study of jockeys in

### Great Britain revealed that changes in the historical handicaps

### for horses have not kept pace with generational increases in

### BM, meaning that current weightlimits are too low for almost

### all jockeys (35). There may be subtle differences between com-

### bat sports regarding the performance advantages of having a

### larger natural BM, as demonstrated by a correlation between

### success and the magnitude of RWG (8). It should be noted,

### however, that although the magnitude of RWG is often used

### as a surrogate measure of the degree of rapid weight loss

### (RWL), it may not be an accurate indicator (4). Nevertheless,

### in grappling sports like wrestling and judo, a larger BM and

### muscle mass/power may conferperformance advantage (36),

### whereas in striking sports,such as taekwondo and boxing,

### greater stature and limb length provide an advantage that is

### only partially correlated with BM (37,38). Meanwhile studies

### in combat sports involving striking and grappling (e.g., MMA)

### have failed to show a correlation between RWG and competition

### success (39,40). Aside from any direct competitive advantage,

### the culture of weight-making is entrenched by perceived psycho-

### logical benefits around sport identity and the feeling of focus,

### commitment, and self-confidence (41).

### Common Weight-Making Practices

### For the purposes of this position stand, chronic BM man-

### agement includes strategies implemented over several weeks

### or months to facilitate a change in fat mass (FM) and fat-free

### mass (FFM) (sometimes termed interchangeably as lean body

### mass). Here, the athlete aims to reduce FM while maintaining

### or gaining FFM. Conversely, RWL (sometimes also called acute

### weight loss or AWL) includes the intentional manipulation of

### total body water, glycogen stores and gastrointestinal tract

### contents over a period of hours or days. Typically, RWL has

### limited impact on FM or FFM, although changes in body wa-

### ter may cause artifacts in assessments of body composition via

### various modalities and some loss of fat-free dry solid mass can

### occur in as little as 4 days (42,43). While specific BM manage-

### ment practices vary according to sport and athlete caliber, the

### majority of athletes engage in both chronic and acute strate-

### gies (3,22,24,25,29,31,44).

### The 1996 ACSM Guidelines (7) advocated an emphasis on

### chronic BM management practices, including gradual dieting

### and manipulation of training load, while promoting a cau-

### tious approach to acute strategies to mitigate their potential

### health and performance implications. Indeed, there is evidence

### of favorable outcomes when such an approach is implemented

### (26,28,45). Nevertheless, there is renewed focus on health and

### performance effects of chronic energy deficits in athletes, be-

### cause of the recognition of concerns associated with low en-

### ergy availability and the sequalae described in the Female

### and Male Athlete Triad (46) the Relative Energy Deficiency

### weight category sports (48). Since this enhanced interest is be-

### yond the scope of this Statement, the reader is directed to spe-

### cific resources on strategies and concerns for chronic weight

### loss in athletes (49–53), allowing the current article to focus

### on RWL while acknowledging that it occurs against a larger

### backdrop of body composition manipulation.

### Table 2 provides a summary of commonly utilized RWL strat-

### egies, including their associated potential benefits and disadvan-

### tages. It is important to understand the degree to which these

### strategies are utilized when attempting to infer health and/or per-

### formance implications. Acute restriction of fluid intake and/or

### promotion of sweat loss through exercise to levels commonly ob-

### served in routine training (e.g.,2%to3%BMreduction)are

### likely to have few disadvantages, especially if aggressive recovery

### strategies are implemented subsequent to weigh-in. However, a

### singular focus on these practices to facilitate larger amounts of

### weight loss (>3% BM reduction) may have substantial negative

### implications to health and performance. According to recent sur-

### veys of RWL practices among athletes, the concerning strategies

### of vomiting and use of banned diuretics and diet pills have a low

### prevalence of use (3,24,25). However, the use of thermally

### stressful environments like saunas to elicit sweat losses remains

### common (3,24,25). There also appears to be an increased inter-

### est in the use of other novel strategies such as water loading

### (3,24,25), a practice in which the health and performance im-

### plications are only now beginning to emerge (55). The contin-

### ued reliance on RWL strategies for weight making should not

### come as a surprise, since athletes identify fellow athletes and

### coaches as primary influencers on their BM management prac-

### tices (2,24,41). It also should be noted that parents have an im-

### portant influence on young athletes, but lesser so as athletes age

### (56,57). Practitioners who work with weight category athletes

### should have a clear understanding of their specific weight mak-

### ing practices and timeframes of implementation, not only to as-

### sist with better management of weight loss goals, but to

### consider postweigh in recovery practices that can mitigate the

### health and/or performance consequences.

### Opportunities for Recovery after Weigh-in

### The period between weigh-in and the event offers an oppor-

### tunity for an athlete to consume foods and drinks that address

### preevent nutrition goals against a background of the physio-

### logical and psychological challenges imposed by their RWL

### practices (54). What is needed to optimize the athlete's nutri-

### tional status for competition will vary according to the type

### and magnitude of RWL practices undertaken and the competi-

### tive event. What is practical to achieve will depend on whether

### the timeframe will allow consumption, digestion/absorption,

### and restoration of suboptimal nutritional status (54). Table 3

### summarizes common sports nutrition advice for such processes,

### emphasizing restoration of body fluids and muscle glycogen

### stores as common goals (58,59), and noting specific recommen-

### dations should be applied with caution and practical consider-

### ations. For example, it may not always be possible to fully

### recover in the available time period; here the athlete should pri-

### oritize recovery of what is mostimportant for their event and

### ensure that recovery eating doesnot interfere with event perfor-

### mance, either by creating gut discomfort from the consumption

### of large volumes of fluid and nutrients or interfering with the re-

### quirement to make weight again within day(s).

### Several studies have examined how well recovery can be

### achieved in the typical timeframe between weigh-in and event,

### investigating the change in physiological parameter (e.g.,de-

### gree of dehydration) and/or the restoration of performance.

### The literature is difficult to fully interpret since studies differ

### in the magnitude of weight loss, whether single or several strat-

### egies have been involved in the weight making and/or recovery,

### and the time course of each process. Most importantly, studies

### are typically laboratory based, quantifying performance in

### measures of work, power, or force production. Although these

### measures are presumed to contribute to success in competition,

### they may not be a perfect proxy. Furthermore, they may not

### consider that competitive success is a relative outcome (e.g.,

### comparing athletes to each other) rather than absolute (com-

### paring an athlete to their personal best). The results of studies

### that have measured the effects of recovery strategies on per-

### formance in a meaningful way are discussed in the follow-

### ing section.

### Alternative methods of recovery, such as intravenous fluid

### administration, might have appeal following the weigh in.

### Studies demonstrate some efficacy in nonweight-category ath-

### letes who partially rehydrate by this means but the effects are

### no better than those of orally administered fluids (60,61). Use

### of such methods are strongly discouraged given they are

### banned by sports governing bodies.

### Concerns Associated with Weight Making Practices

### Weight making strategies may jeopardize the athlete's health

### and safety and alter attributes or whole elements of performance.

### Since the issues of health and safety should be of primary con-

### cern, these will be addressed first. The most serious consequence

### of making weight is death; such outcomes have been reported in

### association with extreme practices in taekwondo (62), college

### wrestling (63), MMA (64,65), judo (66), Muay Thai (67), and

### lightweight rowing (68). Such tragic and avoidableoccurrences

### are typically associated with cardiovascular complications

### and/or heat stroke secondary to severe fluid restriction, pas-

### sive heat exposure or strenuous exercise to induce large sweat

### losses, or combinations of these strategies (62–68). Indeed,

### substantial reduction in body water, including plasma volume,

### is associated with cardiovascular strain and impaired thermoreg-

### ulation in hot environments (69,70). Depending on the method

### of water loss, electrolyte imbalances also may occur, and, ac-

### cording to altered electromyography activity, increase the risk

### of muscle heat cramps (71). Acute renal stress or injury also

### has been associated with extreme fluid loss during RWL in some

### weight category athletes (27,72). Although the concept of RWL

### prior to a competitive event suggests that it is a short-term expe-

### rience, it should be noted that in sports involving regular compe-

### tition (e.g., weekly matches during the college wrestling season),

### this protocol is repeated many times.

### Chronic exposure to negative energy balance and low en-

### ergy availability is associated with effects on many aspects of

### health and function including impairments to metabolic, en-

### docrine, and reproductive systems, as well as protein synthesis

### and growth in child and adolescent athletes; all contribute to

### the syndrome known as RED-S (47). Reductions in testoster-

### one and insulin-like growth factor 1 concentrations have been

### observed during the 3- to 4-month competitive wrestling sea-

### son (27,28,73–75), as well as in lightweight rowers (76) and

### jockeys (77). Acute markers of impairments in protein status

#### 204 Volume 20Number 4April 2021 Special Communication


### in these wrestlers include decreases in rapid-turnover plasma

### proteins indicative of protein-calorie nutrition status (73,78),

### while rates of muscle protein synthesis in response to resistance

### training are reduced with several days of low energy availability

### (LEA) (79). Meanwhile, its long-term translation into loss of

### FFM has been reported across a wrestling season (73,78) and

### as a significant contribution to the BM losses in a boxing training

### camp (26). Reduced bone mineral density is often associated

### with LEA but may be altered by the interaction with bone load-

### ing exercise. For example, although some studies of combat

### athletes have shown evidence of adverse outcomes for acute

### markers of bone turnover, bone mineral density (BMD) did

### not appear to be affected by weight reduction (28,80,81).

### However, lightweight rowers report lower BMD than their

### heavy weight counterparts and a high risk of rib stress frac-

### tures (48). Conflicting outcomes exist within the same sport

### with low BMD reported in jockeys (23) but no differences in

### BMD observed between novice and veteran jockeys who have

### many more years of experience and exposure to making

### weight (82). Other outcomes associated with RED-S observed

### among weight category athletes include dyslipidemias and re-

### duction in resting metabolic rate (48). The effect of LEA on

### the immune system is complex (83), and although some

### markers of diminished immune system function have been re-

### ported in weight category athletes (84–89), it is unclear

### whether these changes put weight-category athletes at greater

### risk for illness during heavy training or weight loss periods.

### The effects of RWL, or its components, on behavioral and

### psychological issues have been considered from a number of

### angles. With potential pressure to either lose weight and/or

### to maintain meticulous control of body composition, it is

### not surprising that athletes may exhibit disordered eating or

### eating disorders. Studies have reported that some but not all

### cohorts involved in weight making sports have higher scores

### on eating disorder survey instruments than age-matched con-

### trols or other athletes (23,90,91). Other investigations have

### focused on changes in measures of mood states during RWL

### activities, with consistent findings of reductions in vigor, and el-

### evations in anxiety, anger, fatigue, depression, and confusion

Strategies for recovery of fluid and carbohydrate stores between weigh-in and event.

Issues General Recommendations Practical Issues to Consider in Weight Category Sports

Rehydration (58) Consume a fluid volume equal to ~150% of the fluid
deficit to allow for ongoing urine and sweat losses
during the recovery period
Replace lost electrolytes, particularly sodium, as part of
the fluid plan to promote rapid reequilibration of fluid
compartments and to minimize urine losses. Thiscan be
achieved by consuming electrolyte-containing drinks
that are specifically developed for rehydration (e.g.,oral
rehydration solutions or ~50 to 60 mmol sodium) and/
or consuming salt-rich foods with other drink choices
Note that the addition of protein to a drink or in food
consumed at the same time can enhance effective
rehydration by enhancing fluid retention, and may
contribute to other recovery goals
The rate and volume of intake of fluid needs to consider
gastric emptying (larger volumes increase rate of
emptying) vs fluid retention (a slower more frequent
intake of fluid will reduce perturbation in plasma
osmolality and reduce urine losses)

```
It may not be possible to consume enough fluid in the
available timeframe between weigh-in and event to allow
for full restoration of fluid losses; a protocol that
integrates considerations around gastro-intestinal
absorption rates, urinary losses, and gut comfort for the
event should be developed according to individual
experience
Replacement of electrolytes is more important when
dehydration has been achieved via sweating (with
accompanying loss of electrolytes) than fluid restriction
Consuming a large fluid bolus (e.g.,10mL·kg−^1 )
immediately after weigh-in, followed by continued
smaller volumes at regular intervals will maintain a high
rate of gastric emptying (via high gastric volume). This
also may reduce the need to consume fluids just before
the event, risking gut discomfort during competition
If further weigh-ins are required (e.g., multiple days of
competition), the athlete should rehydrate for the first
bout according to the importance of hydration to
performance, then repeat the dehydration-rehydration
protocol for subsequent days
If further weight limits are imposed (e.g., mat-side
weigh-inwith limits for regain following official weigh-in),
the athlete should be cautious that initial weight making
was not so severe that appropriate competition
preparation cannot be achieve with the allowable
recovery regain
```
Glycogen storage/
restoration of
CHO availability
(59)

```
Take advantage of enhanced rates of glycogen
restoration when muscle stores are most depleted and
in the period (up to 4 h) immediately after an exercise
bout. Adequate energy availability is required to
optimize glycogen storage from a given amount
of CHO.
Enhance early postexercise recovery with a higher rate
of CHO intake (~1 g·kg BM−^1 ·h−^1 ), especially by
consuming in frequent small feedings.
Focus on CHO-rich foods with a moderate to high GI to
provide a readily available source of substrate for
glycogen synthesis.
Add protein to CHO-rich meals and snacks to promote
glycogen storage when CHO intake is suboptimal,
especially during the first hours of recovery. An intake
of ~20 g to 25 g of high-quality protein appears to
optimize this effect while also meeting goals for
postexercise muscle protein synthesis.
Target daily CHO intake based on body mass (or proxy
for the volume of active muscle) and exercise load.
Guidelines can be suggested but need to be fine-tuned
according to the athlete's overall dietary goals and
feedback from training.
o Moderate exercise load: 5 to 7 g·kg BM−^1 ·h−^1
o Heavy exercise load to glycogen supercompensation:
6 to 1 g·kg BM−^1 ·h−^1
```
```
Although the athlete may have reduced glycogen stores
as a result of weight making strategies, the importance
of glycogen to performance will vary according to the
type of sportand the number of events/bouts that will be
undertaken on a day. The athlete should refuel
accordingly
It may not be possible to refuel sufficiently if the
postweigh in period is brief (e.g., 1 h to 2 h) and weight
making practices have involved severe CHO restriction
and/or exercise. The athlete should consider this when
undertaking weight making practices.
Food choices should consider CHO targets, other
nutritional goals (e.g., protein intake), and gut comfort.
Compact and fluid-based choices may be most suitable,
and intake of fat and fiber should be moderated.

### temporary alterations in the brain structure (98–100), which have

### been associated with transient declines in cognitive test scores

### (101) and visuomotor performance (102). Interestingly, wres-

### tlers performed worse on concussion screening tests when

### dehydrated compared with their performance at baseline in

### an euhydrated state (103). Wide variability in concussion test-

### ing responses in nonconcussed boxers also has been explained

### in part by dehydration (104). Implications of structural changes

### or possibly reduced brain blood flow with dehydration (105)

### include that the brain might be more physically vulnerable to

### concussion, or that impaired decision making and motor con-

### trol during competition may predispose weight-restricted ath-

### letes to injuries. However, to date, empirical data are lacking

### to confirm an increased risk of brain injury with dehydration.

### It is important to consider the real and perceived effects of

### RWL on performance in weight category sports since this is

### likely to underpin the motives of athletes and coaches around

### their practices and the capacity for change. A summary of

### studies of the effect of RWL on sport/exercise performance

### (Table 4) illustrates the complexity of this issue by demon-

### strating a range of outcomes (trivial effects, negative effects,

### and positive effects) from a range of study designs. Indeed, no

### single answer is likely because, as demonstrated in Table 1,

### chronic weight loss, RWL practices, and the characteristics

### of performance are all variable. Studies of isolated elements,

### such as the effect of dehydration on an aspect of power or en-

### durance, may be limited by failing to capture some of the char-

### acteristics of weight category sports that can either mitigate or

### accentuate the performance effect. Others that include recov-

### ery strategies to overturn some of the negative outcomes of

### RWL may be more ecologically valid, but still fail to capture

### elements of performance or characteristics, such as repeated

### performance bouts, the effect of environmental conditions,

### or the need to weigh-in several times in a multiday competi-

### tion. Nevertheless, an overall conclusion from this literature

### might be that RWL activities cause some direct decrements

### to elements of sports performance (Table 4), but these can be

### at least attenuated if there is sufficient time after the weigh-in

### to allow recovery nutrition strategies.

### A major complication of defining the effect of RWL on per-

### formance is the concept of relative performance, which notes

### that competition success is awarded to the athlete who is best

### within their event pool rather than to the athlete who achieves

### their best performance level on the day of the event. The cul-

### ture and experience of many athletes in weight category sports

### is that although RWL may reduce an athlete's absolute perfor-

### mance, RWL allows them to compete in a lower weight division

### where they may have a physical or psychological advantage,

### especially in events where RWL or the chance to recover after

### the weigh-in have minimal effects on performance. Yet, this is

### exceedingly challenging to quantify where it is most profound

### and relevant: in competition. Table 4 also includes studies of

### real-life attempts to observe correlations between the magni-

### tude of RWL (measured or inferred from the BM increase af-

### ter the weigh-in) and competition success. Even these studies

### have shown different outcomes, with findings spread across

### observations that athletes who appear to compete with the

### greatest magnitude of weight manipulation can be either less

### successful (39,125), equally successful (122,126,128) or more

### successful (36,129) than their counterparts who practice smaller

### to gain better insights, it is recognized that outcomes are affected

### by methodological issues as well as real differences arising from

### the requirements of the sport. Regardless, there is evidence that

### at least some athletes sacrifice performance as well as incur

### health risks because of their weight making practices.

### Programs and Rule Changes to Address Unsafe Weight

### Making Practices

### In the 1960s, The National Federation of State High School

### Athletic Associations (NFHS) instructed U.S. states to introduce

### weight control plans to limit harmful RWL practices in high

### school wrestling (131). Initial attempts, focusing largely on athlete

### and coach education, had limited success (132,133), necessitating

### the development of structured programs alongside rule changes to

### make harmful weight-making impractical (see Table 5).

### The first formal intervention was the Wisconsin Wrestling

### Minimum Weight Program (134), which led to a small, signifi-

### cant reduction in harmful weight-making practices in that state

### (135). Nevertheless, some wrestlers continued to undergo large

### RWL (>7 kg) for competition using undesirable methods (e.g.,

### training in heated rooms) and scores on a nutrition knowledge

### survey were no higher than those recorded before the program

### began (135). High school wrestlers subject to these rules also con-

### tinued to engage in aggressive RWL during international-style

### wrestling tournaments (136), which occurred outside the scholas-

### tic season and its weight control regulations.

### In 1997, following the tragic deaths of three wrestlers, the

### National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) introduced

### a Wrestling Weight Certification Program (137), which ex-

### panded on the previous Wisconsin Program. The program:

### (i) limited weight loss to≤1.5% BM per week; (ii) determined

### a minimal competitive weight for each wrestler based on a

### lower limit of 5% body fat (males); (iii) moved weigh-ins to 1 h

### to 2 h precompetition; (iv) added 7 lbs (3.2 kg) to each weight

### category limit (e.g., 190 lbs became 197 lbs); (v) prohibited the

### use of unsafe weight making methods; (vi) randomized the or-

### der of weight class competition (instead of heavier athletes

### competing later); and (vii) required athletes to pass a hydra-

### tion test (urine specific gravity≤1.020) at the weigh-in. When

### compared to practices observed prior to the NCAA Program

### (132,138,139), studies showed that wrestlers had less seasonal

### variation in BM (139–143), better retention of FFM (140), and

### a marked reduction in RWG (reduced to 1.2 ± 0.9 kg) between

### the weigh-in and competition (143). Taken collectively, the

### NCAA program reduced harmful weight-making practices to

### a greater extent than the Wisconsin program.

### Despite this success, there are some concerns relating to the

### NCAA methods. The minimal competitive weight rule has been

### adopted by the U.S. Collegiate Sprint Football League (21),

### where male athletes must weigh under 178 lbs (81 kg) with

### no less than 5% body fat; and by the NFHS who set a higher

### minimum body fat (7% for males, 12% for females) to allow

#### Table 6.

Recommendations for safer weight making practices in weight category sports.

Sporting organizations, practitioners/clinicians, coaches, and athletes involving events with weight categories should recognize the

```
unique characteristics of their sport and support practices that promote safe and equitable competition for all competitors.
```
Sporting organizations should continually review the weight making practices used within their sport to evolve the specific rules and

```
regulations around weight categories and weigh-ins to deter unsafe practices.
```
Continued evaluation of formal programs and sharing of best practices between weight-category sports are encouraged to fine-tune

```
protocols based on success and failure to improve rapid weight loss practices, change the culture, and enhance safetyand health of the
competitors.
```
Strategies should discourage any weight making among the minors and the youngest of participants and fully inform adult competitors

```
of safety and health risks.
```
Theselectionofasuitableweightcategoryforeachathlete,andthetimelyachievementoftruealterationsinBMtowardstheeventtarget

```
should underpin all weight making practices. A suitableweight category is one that can be safelyachieved by the athletewithout undue
physical, nutritional or psychological stress.
```
If formal weight-category selection programs have not been implemented, clinicians are encouraged to evaluate the athlete's body
composition, not BM alone, guide weight class selection, and provide the caveat that minimal weight may not be the optimal
performance weight.

The athlete's natural or day to day BM should bewithin reach of their specific weight class, allowing them to achieve their usual training
goals while maintaining dietary practices that support adequate energy availability, requirements for all nutrients, and a healthy
relationship with food and its contribution to growth, development, and the quality of life.

Critical planning and education are required to integrate nutrition needs with the training volume to ensure maintaining nutrient status
while succeeding with FM reduction, maintaining FFM as much as possible, and improving competition readiness

### for sex differences and maturation in adolescents (131). How-

### ever, these standards have not been enforced across the United

### States and there is no guarantee of healthy weight manage-

### ment in high school or collegiate sports. Another concern is

### the stark differences in methods and procedures used to deter-

### mine minimum competitive weight between states (144), which

### undermines the validity and reliability of the measurements. The

### use of urine specific gravity to measure hydration status at the of-

### ficial weigh-in also has limitations: current cut-offs can identify

### euhydrated athletes, but false-positives may be common, leading

### to athletes being incorrectly classified as dehydrated and ex-

### cluded from competition (145,146).

### Interventions like the Wisconsin and NCAA programs are

### challenging to implement for sports that lack the organizational

### structure of the US high-school and collegiate system. However,

### other combat sports have started to address the issue. Following

### a death in 2015, ONE Championship—Asia's largest MMA,

### Muay Thai, and kickboxing promotion—implemented a series

### of rule changes similar to the NCAA Program (147). More recently,

### the California State Athletic Commission introduced a 10-point

### plan in an attempt to reduce RWL to less than 10% (148). While

### these programs are promising, there are currently no data to

### show their impact on athlete weight-making behaviors.

### A novel approach to eliminate weight making is the re-

### placement of weight categories with height categories (1,37),

### which may be a viable approach for striking-based combat

### sports where limb-length is an important factor for competi-

### tive success. Other sport organizations have opted for simple

### changes to the weigh-in structure. Both World Taekwondo

### and the International Judo Federation now implement an

### evening-before competition weigh-in with a reweigh limit on

### the morning of competition (12,15). A sample of athletes com-

### plete the reweigh, with those weighing >5% above the upper

### limit of the weight category excluded from competition. The

### International Boxing Federation (IBF) applies a similar rule

### to championship bouts, with a reweigh limit 10 lbs (4.5 kg)

### above the upper limit of the weight category (10). A retrospec-

### tive analysis of 77 IBF bouts showed the average RWG ranged

### from−0.3 to 6.4 kg (125), but it did not specify how many

### athletes exceeded the reweigh limit or if they were excluded

### from competition. While it is a common rule change, the effect

### of a morning reweigh limit on weight making behaviors needs

### further evaluation. A criticism of the rule is that athletes can

### easily manipulate their BM to stay within the reweigh limit,

### then continue to regain BM between the reweigh and compe-

### tition (Table 5).

### Despite several decades of work, harmful weight-making

### still exists in weight-category sports. However, resistance to

### new ideas should not be a deterrent to change: prior to the

### implementation of the Wisconsin program, most coaches

### (>60%) were opposed to it, but four years later nearly all

### (>95%) coaches supported it (134). New programs and reg-

### ulations should involve all key stakeholders, be pilot tested,

### evaluated, and revised, as necessary. These then need to be

### implemented by the largest sport organizations and adopted

### downstream by national and regional federations to have

### the greatest impact.

### Summary

### A variety of sports involve weight categories with the aim of

### organizing competition that is safe and equitable between

### competitors with similar physical characteristics. Athletes in

### such sports use chronic and acute weight making techniques

### to compete in a weight category that is lower than their“nat-

### ural”weight, gaining a theoretical advantage over smaller op-

### ponents. Extreme weight making practices, however, often

### lead to health and performance concerns. The ingrained cul-

### ture and practices of weight making are difficult to remove

### and should be recognized as being unique to the specific char-

### acteristics of each sport. While no single approach is likely to

### be successful across all weight category sports, guidelines un-

### derpinning programs to address concerns around weight mak-

### ing can be provided in principle (see Table 6). Strategies to

### support education around safer practices include minimal

### competition weight classification based on preseason body

### composition, reductions in the period between weigh-in and

### competition, and prohibition of unhealthy weight loss tech-

### niques. At an individual level, expert guidance by sports nutri-

### tion professionals can help an athlete to establish a pragmatic

### and long-term approach to BM management, recognizing the

### nuances of their sport, to achieve favorable outcomes for both

### health and performance.
