**Abstract:** Most combat sports (CS) are structured in weight categories, and it is very common to
carry out body weight adjustment strategies in order to compete in lower weight categories. For this
reason, different rapid weight loss (RWL) strategies are usually performed to pass the pre-competition
weigh-in test, and then a replenishment of fluids and carbohydrate-rich foods is conducted in an
attempt to recover the weight and avoid a performance loss. In this context, no clear references have
been found on whether these types of strategies have negative effects, impairing the athlete’s combat
and/or physical performance. For this reason, the aim of this study was to review the scientific
literature on the effect of rapid weight reduction strategies on the performance of CS athletes. A
literature search was performed through four different databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web
of Science and ScienceDirect). Four inclusion criteria were established as follows: (1) the subjects
had to be competitors in the CS and carry out RWL strategies; (2) at least two measurement points,
that is, normal conditions and dehydration condition; (3) measurements in a real competition or
simulating the same conditions; (4) original research articles written in English or Spanish and
available in full text. Finally, a total of 16 articles were finally included in this research. All subjects
(n= 184) were athletes from combat disciplines, with a minimum of 3–4 years of practice, as well as
with certain experience in RWL. Six of the studies reported that an RWL strategy of around 5% of
body weight loss did not affect performance parameters. However, the other ten studies with RWL
between 3 and 6% or even higher reported negative effects or impairments on different parameters
related to performance and/or athlete’s psychophysiology, such as perceived fatigue, mood states,
strength and power production, as well as changes in hormonal, blood and urine parameters, body
composition, or the kinematics of the technical gesture. Although there is still no clear answer to the
issue approached in this research, in general terms, it seems that in order to guarantee an acceptable
athletic performance of the competitor, the weight loss should not exceed 3% to≤5% of body weight
together with≥24 h for adequate (or at least partial) recovery and rehydration processes. In addition,
it is highly recommended to lose weight progressively over several weeks, especially focusing on
competitions lasting several days, as well as multiple rounds or qualifying stages.

**1. Introduction**

Combat sports (CS) are disciplines with different weight categories where it is com-
mon for athletes to compete in a category below their natural weight in order to gain a
competitive advantage [ 1 , 2 ]. This advantage focuses on short-term rapid weight loss (RWL),
coinciding with the official weigh-in day, when the competitor is placed in one category or
another. This is followed by rehydration and carbohydrate intake to allow the athlete to
gain weight and thus achieve an advantage over smaller competitors [ 3 , 4 ]. In fact, given the
widespread use of this strategy in CS, nowadays it is practically considered a must in order
to avoid a possible physical disadvantage due to size and/or strength [ 1 , 2 ] However, there
is a great lack of knowledge regarding the ideal way to perform these weight reductions,
often causing athletes to worsen their athletic performance in competition by performing
protocols that are too extreme. As a common example, a very pronounced weight loss
over an acceptable percentage in a very short period of time. Other strategies that could
be considered extreme or unwise include an abusive calorie restriction in the days prior
to the weigh-in, remaining hungry for long periods of time, using the sauna, or the use of
pharmaceutical drugs on certain occasions that are often labelled as illegal by competition
committees [ 5 ]. These methods can lead to severe dehydration, jeopardising not only purely
sporting performance, but also the athletes’ physical health, especially as there is often no
control or supervision during such a process [5–7].
Apart from the negative effects of RWL on parameters related to sports performance,
such as strength (e.g., maximal handgrip and specific grip tests), power outputs, and
specific endurance development [ 6 ], the cognitive and physiological consequences derived
from these strategies must also be taken into consideration [ 8 ]. In terms of cognitive
consequences, several studies showed that short-term memory and mood may be negatively
affected, but once rehydration is conducted, these measures return to near baseline or
normal values, so that these negative effects may be reversible [ 8 ]. In addition, a rapid
weight loss may lead to a decrease in metacognitive performance, which may attenuate
attention and anticipation skills, and thus affect decision-making processes [4,9].
On the other hand, the “weight cycling” (losing and regaining weight repeatedly) was
shown to have marked adverse effects on the athlete’s physiology, e.g., in endocrine (low
concentrations of serum testosterone and prolactin) or renal function. Concerning the renal
function, decreases in the plasma volume could be noted, which contributes to a decrease in
blood flow to the kidneys. This would therefore increase acidity, urine-specific gravity [ 6 ],
and leakage of albumin and leucine amino peptidase into the urine (linked to ischaemia).
Although the effect of weight cycling on strength or aerobic power performance is limited,
it does significantly affect muscular endurance and cardiovascular system, considered
essential in CS due to their particular competitive characteristics [ 2 , 6 , 7 , 10 ]. In addition, it is
important to avoid specific carbohydrate restriction that may affect the athlete’s muscular
capacity, favouring a more balanced calorie restriction in such weight loss strategies [10].
Most CS athletes consider hydration habits to be important for health and athletic
performance, and even though they recognise negative effects on athletic performance due
to RWL, they continue to engage in RWL [ 11 ]. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the
knowledge of RWL methodologies in order to clarify the existing claims thus far [12].
The most commonly used methods of RWL are based on a combination of active and
passive sweating, fluid and food restriction, and the use of plastic or rubber clothing to
induce profuse sweating [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] However, current studies show a new methodology
that is gaining popularity in CS, the so-called “water loading”, purportedly decreasing
body mass through an increasing of the urine production. That consists of consuming large
volumes of water (7–10 L/d) for several days before a subsequent fluid restriction, which
seems to be a safe and effective method of acute bowel evacuation [ 13 ]. This strategy could
be interesting in lean athletes without much fat mass who are losing weight in order to
weigh in for a specific category. At the same time and in parallel to the control of fluid
intake, the most common methodologies of dietary restriction are the consumption of
low-fibre foods, which with a correct intake strategy allow the athlete to better restore


```
energy after weigh-in [ 3 ]. However, the influence of RWL on athletic performance is not
entirely clear, although it seems that weight cuts greater than 5% of body weight would
make it more difficult to repeat an effort continuously over time [12].
On the other hand, although existing studies investigating weight loss strategies in
CS mainly focus on the study of athletes’ hydration index [ 14 , 15 ] or their anthropometric
characteristics [ 3 , 16 ], it is essential to understand the influence of these strategies on athletic
performance, as they are aimed precisely at gaining a competitive advantage [2].
More recently, Brechney et al. [ 1 ] focused their review with a meta-analysis on the
influence of RWL strategies on performance (tests focused on the strength, power, and
endurance of athletes), and the recovery process in CS. In this study, small to moderate
reductions in overall exercise performance, maximal strength, and repeated high intensity
effort were found between pre- and post-RWL strategy (p< 0.03). However, they also
indicated that the entire weight cutting process (RWL to rapid weight gain) is not sufficient
to change the values of an overall exercise performance, as well as short-term tests applied
to CS (anaerobic capacity, maximal strength, and so on). Even though they provided
very valuable information on the influence of RWL protocols on performance, they did
not include as a criterion the application of strategies in real or simulated competitive
situations, with almost all the studies including isolated laboratory tests. Actually, the
studies considering data collected immediately post-competition or -bout were excluded
in their analysis. Therefore, their practical application to the competition or tournament
period, as well as the interest of coaches and athletes, could be limited to a certain extent.
Based on this lack of specific knowledge in competitive situations, the present study
focuses on the effect of different RWL strategies on athletic-performance-related parameters
of CS (power, strength, jump ability, speed, specific combat exercise.. ., among others) in
real or simulated competitive environments. By understanding the impact of those RWL
strategies on CS athletes’ health and performance, coaches will gain useful information on
what strategies to avoid prior to competitions, and how training processes can be optimised
in the run-up to competitions.

**2. Materials and Methods**
2.1. Search Strategy
    This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of
the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) state-
ment [ 17 ]. The search of the scientific literature was conducted between October and
November 2022 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of
Science, and ScienceDirect. Keyword and category search terms were used as follows:
(1) the first search category was related to terms associated with RWL, such as (“Dehy-
dration” OR “Rehydration” OR “water-electrolyte balance” OR “water deprivation” OR
“water loss” OR “Acute weight loss” OR “body weight loss” OR “Weigh-in” OR “Weight
Cutting”); (2) the second category was related to CS, with the terms (“combat sports”
OR “fighting sports” OR “striking sports” OR “boxing” OR “wrestling” OR “karate” OR
“taekwondo” OR “judo”); while the third category (3) referred to athletic performance
(“performance” OR “physical condition*” OR “recovery”). Categories (1)–(3) were related
to each other with the Boolean operator “AND”.

```
2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
For the article selection in the present review, inclusion criteria were previously
established as follows: (1) The subjects had to be competitors in CS with at least >3 years of
competitive experience and carrying out RWL strategies in order to fit into a lower category
than their natural weight. (2) The studies had to take into consideration the effects of the
weight loss strategies on athletic performance parameters (at least two measurement points,
that is, normal conditions and dehydration/weight loss condition). (3) The subjects had to
participate in a real competition or in at least a simulation with comparable conditions or
```

effort. (4) Original research articles were written in English or Spanish and are available in
full text.

2.3. Study Selection

The complete search process was conducted by two independent researchers (M.S.-M.
and G.O.-D.) and supervised by a third one (L.M.M.-A.). Both authors independently used
the search terms to examine the literature in the different meta-search engines selected,
subsequently analysing and screening the titles and abstracts of the resulting articles after
removing the duplicates, and using an excel sheet prepared for that purpose. In the
event of any discrepancies between both researchers during the inclusion process (initial
disagreement rate: 8.3%), there was a discussion and resolution by consensus. In case
such discrepancies persisted, the third reviewer moderated the final consensus process
on the inclusion of the article in the following phase (L.M.M.-A.). To determine the final
reliability between the reviewers after the records screened, Cohen’s Kappa statistic (K)
was calculated (K = 0.93) [ 18 ]. The data extracted from the selected articles were as follows:
study design, participants (number, gender, age, weight, sport), method of weight loss,
magnitude of rapid weight loss and recovery time, duration and time-points assessed, tests
and performance parameters, other records or variables analysed, and finally, main results.
The article selection process was as follows: A total of 303 studies were identified
through the different databases. Six additional articles of interest were identified, as listed
in the references section of recent systematic reviews obtained from the initial search con-
ducted [ 1 , 2 , 5 ]. After eliminating the 150 duplicated articles, a total of 159 articles remained.
Following title/abstract review, 122 articles were excluded as they did not meet the in-
clusion criteria, leaving a total of 35 full text articles assessed for eligibility. Subsequently,
21 were excluded with specific reasons, as 19 of them did not meet the inclusion criteria
(8 of them we systematic reviews of grey literature without peer-reviewing process), and
2 were eliminated as they were only available in Japanese. Therefore, 16 studies were
finally included in this systematic review. Further details on the identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion processes can be found in Figure 1.

2.4. Assessment of Methodological Quality

The assessment of methodological quality was also conducted by two independent
researchers (M.S.-M. and G.O.-D.), supervised and corrected when necessary by a third
one (L.M.M.-A.). For this purpose, the PEDro scale was used [ 19 ], containing originally
11 questions or items that can be answered with a “0” or “1”, depending on compliance
with criteria, with a maximum of 11 points. In this case, due to the nature of the scientific
literature analysed, blinding participants and/or researchers from experimental conditions
is quite complicated or not possible. For that reason, the three questions related to blinding
process were removed from the original scale as previously made by other authors with
similar methodological quality scales [1,20,21].
For the acceptance of the articles, the authors created three categories in order to score
the quality of the articles: very good–excellent (7–8), moderate–good (5–6) and poor (≤4).
The scores relative to the assessment of methodological quality for each article are
detailed in Table 1.

All articles responded had a minimum score of 5, favouring their subsequent accep-
tance and analysis. The results of all the studies were correctly reported, alluding to all the
participants, regardless of the group in which they were allocated, and analysing in depth
the key results considered by the authors. On the other hand, it should be noted that the
allocation of the sample into groups, as well as the data collection by the researchers (items
eliminated), were not blinded in any case. Concerning the item “D-Groups were similar at
baseline with respect to the most important prognostic indicators”, that is, in those studies
without a division into different groups, the item assessment has been omitted.

**3. Results**
3.1. Main Characteristics of the Studies

The characteristics of the different studies are shown in Table 2. All studies included
in this review recruited male and female athletes within the intervention groups (n= 184,
174 male and 10 female athletes). All subjects were athletes from CS, with a minimum of
3 years of practice, as well as certain experience in RWL strategies.
Same-day weight loss by sweating and fluid deprivation was performed in three
studies [ 22 – 24 ]. The rest of the included studies provide at least a few days for weight loss,
also through calorie, energy and/or fluid restriction, specifically a period of 5 days [ 25 – 27 ],
1 complete week/10 days [ 28 – 34 ], or 3/4 weeks [ 35 , 36 ]. In addition, there was a final study
comparing progressive RWL performed weeks in advance (3 weeks of calorie restriction)
with those performed faster or at shorter notice (59 h prior to weighting) [37].
In addition to the RWL typologies and their programming over time, tests applied to
aerobic and anaerobic capacity such as the Wingate [ 23 , 25 , 35 , 37 ] or an arm ergometer [ 27 ]
stood out as performance analysis methods. Similarly, studies applied specific tests for
each combat speciality [ 24 – 26 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 36 ] and measures aimed at determining the athlete’s
strength/performance [ 22 , 28 – 34 , 36 , 37 ] or psychological state [ 29 , 30 , 32 , 36 ]. In addition to
the tests applied to performance, data collection aimed at controlling body composition
and weight [ 22 , 25 , 27 – 32 , 34 – 36 ], and the analysis of blood components [ 22 , 25 – 31 , 37 ] and
urine [22,23,30,34,35] were of particular importance.

3.2. Studies on RWL with No Effects on Performance-Related Parameters

Directly alluding to the findings from the literature, six studies included in the present
review demonstrated that RWL protocols of around 5% of body mass do not produce
significant changes in performance parameters (minimum ofp> 0.5 in all cases). McKenna–
Gillum [ 23 ] reported that mean lower-body anaerobic power was not significantly different
between groups (p= 0.877) and time points, (p= 0.809), after an intervention of ~3% body
mass loss. Their data support that dehydration at this percentage does not impair athletic
performance; therefore, in attaining≤3% of ideal weight before weigh-in, anaerobic power
will not be hindered.
Taking into consideration specific performance parameters within the martial dis-
cipline, Artioli et al. [ 25 ] revealed no group (control vs. 5% body mass loss), time or
interaction main effects for time structure patterns or number of attacks during judo com-
bats. In addition, no main group or interaction effects for mean and peak power and
total work were found between groups, as well as no differences and effects for other
complementary parameters measured such as haematocrit and plasma lactate. Thus, as
suggested by the authors, RWL strategies did not affect athletic performance.

Similarly, Lopes-Silva et al. [ 26 ], applying a 5% of RWL, showed no significant main
effects on condition (control, placebo, and caffeine groups) for the number of judo throws or
special judo fitness test performance index. Concerning the RPE, the group taking caffeine
pills during the recovery period showed lower values compared to the placebo group
(p< 0.05). Conversely, the La- values became elevated in caffeine group in comparison to
control or placebo group, increasing as the special judo test progressed (p< 0.05). There
was no effect of condition for HR values (p> 0.05).
Along the same lines, a RWL of 5% led to no significant changes between conditions
in plasma lactate, variables analysed during recovery (energy and macronutrient intake),
or performance variables (mean power, peak power, or total work) (p> 0.05) [ 27 ]. Like-
wise, Barbas et al. [ 31 ] reported no differences for all dependent variables measured and
compared between baseline (T1) and pre-1st match (T2) following an isolated weight loss
process (~6% BM loss) such as anaerobic- and wrestling-related performance tests, heart
rate, lactate concentration, CK, glucose, and other physiological parameters (p> 0.05).
Moreover, RWL is capable of achieving greater weight loss compared to progres-
sive weight loss strategy (p< 0.01) [ 37 ]; however, no differences were found for sprint
performance—30 m—and total work output during the Wingate test after a 5% of body
weight loss following RWL strategy. On the contrary, their results suggested a better me-
chanical functioning after a progressive weight loss strategy (p< 0.01), even if the RWL has
preserved capability of the neuromuscular system to produce force. In any case, the RWL
reported no general impairments on performance-related parameters.

3.3. Studies on Negative Effects of RWL on Performance-Related Parameters

Ten studies included in this review reported negative effects or impairments in perfor-
mance and physiological parameters due to RWL strategies.
Kraemer et al. [ 28 ] showed a progressive loss of performance when data were collected
during a 2-day within a five-bout wrestling tournament (~6% body weight loss). Significant
differences (p< 0.5) were found in the perceived fatigue of the wrestlers after each bout
compared to the initial value (1.21 vs. 6.75 match 1; 1.8 vs. 6.8 match 2; 2.8 vs. 6.92 match 3;
2.38 vs. 7.33 match 4; 2.54 vs. 7.58 match 5). In agreement with the consistent increase in
fatigue values over the tournament, there were significant lower values in the handgrip
and “bear hug” tests (p≤0.5), especially in the first fight, together with reductions in knee
flexion, fast knee extension, and slow elbow extension torque values (isokinetic strength
impairments) as the tournament progressed (p≤0.5).
Physiological changes were observed as well, specifically a chronic reduction in resting
serum testosterone, a general low testosterone response, and an increase in dopamine con-
centration throughout the tournament. Other hormonal parameters and blood components
were modified as well, showing very elevated values compared to baseline and pre-fight
ones (i.e., plasma osmolality, creatine kinase, and cortisol).
Furthermore, significant differences in several physical and physiological parameters
after a 3-h dehydration period (3–4% body weight loss) were found by Barley et al. [ 22 ].
Differences were revealed in the ability to perform repetitions in isokinetic strength tests
after the dehydration period, with a reduction in the number of contractions completed
during the fatiguing exercise protocol (17±7 vs. 23±8,p< 0.001), and an increase in
perceived fatigue after dehydration (17±6 vs. 6±2,p< 0.003) and in the following
3 h (11±5 vs. 6±2,p< 0.012). In addition, significant variations right after dehydration
were found in the body composition of the wrestlers (Pre 80±10 vs. Post 77±10,
p< 0.001, for dehydration group), as well as serum osmolality (293 vs. 285.1 mOsm,
p =0.003); hematocrit (45 vs. 43,p =0.034), resting heart rate (117±21 vs. 56±9,p< 0.001),
and tympanic-core temperature (p< 0.001) for dehydration vs. control group, respectively.
Significant and negative differences in urine osmolality and urine specific gravity were
shown in dehydration group compared to the control group at the end of 3 h of dehydration
and were maintained after the 3 h rehydration period (p< 0.001).


In a comparable way, Kurylas et al. [ 35 ] showed significant impairments of anaerobic
performance parameters after 4 weeks of energy and fluid restriction (~6% BM loss). After
analysing the values of a Wingate test, decreases in peak power (p= 0.021), mean power
(p= 0.039), and total work performed (p= 0.036) were shown comparing a 4-weeks period
and the day before the fight (weigh-in), as well as weigh-in and the fight day after the
hydration. A significant increase in urine osmolality (p< 0.05) and urine specific gravity
(p< 0.01) were also noted in a comparison between 4 weeks before and the day before
the fight. Finally, it is noted that the largest statistical difference found between the data
collection 4 weeks prior to the fight and the pre-fight date is based on changes in lactate
concentration and the body mass in the wrestlers.
Applying a (~5% BM loss), Degoutte et al. [ 30 ] reported reduction in several variables,
such as left handgrip (53.6±2.7 vs. 50.4±2.5 kg;p< 0.01,−5%) or testosterone and
insulin concentrations, as well as an increase in ACTH and cortisol, among other variables
(p< 0.05). The experimental group had several changes concerning the biochemical test,
with a significative increase in uric acid, glycerol, and free fat acid concentrations (p< 0.05).
Furthermore, even if Koral–Dosseville [ 36 ] found no differences in some variables
measured between baseline and weight-in time point (i.e., squat jump and countermove-
ment jump ratio, or repetitions of favourite judo movements for 5 s), a procedure main
effect ofp< 0.01 and a group x procedure interaction ofp< 0.5 were reported within the
specific judo test for 30 s after the RWL period (2–6% BM loss).
Additionally, taking into consideration a secondary analysis, they found differences
between genders, where male athletes reported higher values compared to female competi-
tors for squat jump, countermovement jump, and mean power. Likewise, they reported
significant negative changes for psychology-related variables. Specifically, for the experi-
mental group (2–6% BM loss), the POMS scores were increased for tension (only female)
and confusion (both genders) (p< 0.05) and decreased for vigour in both genders (p< 0.05).
Similar findings were revealed by Filaire et al. [ 29 ], where a significant increase for the
states of confusion, anger, fatigue, and tension, as well as a decreased level of vigour, were
found after the weight loss period (~5%). A significant decrease in left handgrip values
(p< 0.05) and a higher level of triglycerides and free fatty acid 24 h before the championship
(p< 0.05) were also found.
Lastly, Barley et al. [ 22 ] analysed other psychological parameters in their study, such
as perception of tension, depression, confusion, and anger (POMS) being greater after
dehydration when compared with control (p< 0.5). Degoutte et al. [ 30 ] also found an
increased score for tension, fatigue, and anger, while vigour decreased in a significant way.
Including a large percentage of body mass loss, two studies were included in this
review. Alves et al. [ 34 ], with a 9.9% BM loss, demonstrated an important decline in
handgrip strength from baseline to weigh-in (p= 0.001) and match time (p= 0.001), and
a significant increase in urine density values from baseline to weigh-in and match time
(p =0.05). In the same line, Camarço et al. [ 32 ] presented a two-case study with athletes
carrying out a 9.1 or 5.3% BM loss strategy, showing an important decrease of 55–45.1%, re-
spectively, in salivary nitrite concentration during the weigh-in after RWL. This percentage
was only partially recovered through the replacement (35.9–25.5% for 9.1 and 5.3% of BM
loss). Concerning cognitive tasks, the number of mistakes at any time was higher with 9.1%
compared to another case study with a lower percentage (5.3%), especially during the fight
day. Muscle power decreased at weigh-in time point in both cases, not being re-established
after the weight gain (only the athlete with 9.1% of BM loss).
Moreover, Moghaddami et al. [ 24 ] found a reduction in the performance after a period
of 3×20 min in a sauna (~4.3% BM loss). The analysis of kinematic parameters revealed
an acute dehydration impact and significant variations in almost all body segments (shoul-
der, pelvis, knee, trunk, and thigh) concerning linear and angular VelMax, and position
(p< 0.001). Additionally, significant reductions in body composition parameters were
shown (weight pre, 71.1±11.8 vs. post, 68.0±11.4,p= 0.001; %fat pre, 4.9±1.4 vs. post,
4.8±1.35,p= 0.008; total body water pre, 45.9±6.4 vs. post, 43.2±6.0,p= 0.001).


Finally, Liu et al. [ 33 ], also from a biomechanical point of view, found that even if
the total reaction (central nervous system) is better thanks to the replacement period, a
complete weight cutting process (including a ~4.5% BM loss and a replacement strategy)
has a negative effect on the peripherical nervous system reaction time (limbs’ movements)
being−19.23% slower than normal, as well as a negative effect on striking accuracy
(−7.46%). Three striking styles were also negatively affected in terms of power generation
(−10 to−63%).

**4. Discussion**

This systematic review focuses on the effect of different RWL strategies in athletic-
performance-related parameters of combat sports in real or simulated competitive environ-
ments. The debate over whether or not such strategies affect athletic performance remains
unanswered in a certain way, since multiple factors come into play, such as the different
strategies used for weight loss, the percentage of body weight lost, and the orientation
towards either dehydration or food/calorie restriction [ 1 ]. Moreover, the body’s compen-
satory effects following severe or very severe restriction result in a “rebound” reaction
and subsequent weight gain of equal or greater magnitude than the restriction, which
competitors should monitor and be aware of [38,39].
In addition, one of the key elements in weight loss strategies is to know where the limit
of weight cutting lies. The majority of existing negative evidence is related to extreme body
weight loss between 10 and 17% [40,41]. The debate on the extreme weight cut appears to
divide opinion within the combat sports community (coaches, competitors, fans, and so on).
It remains complicated to establish what is the limit of weight cutting and, at least, what are
the real effects of weight cutting on performance. The weight cutting can change in severity,
finding some competitors just dropping or adjusting their weight just a few kilograms or
pounds, while other fighters develop extreme weight cutting strategies, losing more than
11–12% of body mass in trying to obtain a clear advantage over their opponents [42].
According to the studies analysed in this review, the percentage of body weight
that can be lost without jeopardising athletes’ performance in a significant way could
be set between 3% and <5% in general terms. The main problem encountered is the
diversity in study designs, as well as the percentages and weight loss strategies used in the
investigations. Actually, this is a critical interval since previous data have established
somewhat contradictory statements, where some studies indicate that drastic weight
reduction affects performance, while others reveal no negative impact on it, at least up to a
certain percentage of body weight loss.
On the one hand, studies by Artioli et al. [ 25 ] and Lopes-Silva et al. [ 26 ] showed in a
sample of professional judo fighters that a loss of up to 5% of body weight, followed by 4 h
of recovery, did not affect competitive performance. Along the same lines, the studies by
Mendes et al. [ 27 ] and Fogelholm et al. [ 37 ] provided evidence that RWL, as long as it is
less than 5% of body weight and has a few hours to refeed and rehydrate after the weigh-in,
does not affect high-intensity performance, sprint performance, and anaerobic power, at
least in male athletes.
This is supported by studies where no significant changes were found in muscular
activity even the athletes performed a 4% hypohydration [ 43 , 44 ]. Additionally, Cengiz [ 45 ]
and Barbas et al. [ 31 ] already established that body mass loss should exceed 5–6% before
impairments in anaerobic and specific performance-related parameters appear.
The above studies maintain a specific limit of maximum weight loss to ensure control
of performance loss, but there are studies that make specific reference to fluid loss, making
a comparison only between a baseline state of hydration and a weight adjustment using
dehydration-only strategies. In this regard, Yamashita et al. [ 46 ] demonstrated that a
hypohydration level of 2.25% body mass did not affect high-intensity intermittent exercise
performance compared to baseline values, with no effect on the various lactic and alactic
mechanisms of competitors. Along the same lines, McKenna–Gillum [ 23 ], established the
limit of weight loss due to dehydration at 3%, agreeing with the risks associated with


the statements of Yamashita et al. [ 46 ]. They revealed that dehydration at ~3% body
mass loss did not impair anaerobic power. Therefore, a wrestler attempting to adjust the
weight in order to compete in a different category should be focused on≤3% BM loss
before weigh-in.
However, Yamashita et al. [ 46 ] stated that the conditioning factor for not exceed-
ing the limit of approximately 2–3% hypohydration lies in the affection of the aerobic
system through this fluid restriction, which can influence the energy supply to the ath-
letes, conditioning the maintenance of anaerobic exercise during intermittent exercise,
and subsequently, the athletic performance. Thus, aerobic performance is one of the keys
to competitive performance in CS [ 47 ], so controlling the factors that influence aerobic
performance is essential in the training processes of these disciplines. In this regard, it
is important to remember that time-motion analysis in combat sports have reported an
important ratio of high-intensity efforts, being a critical factor within the match perfor-
mance, especially when prolonging combat during the bout (aerobic metabolism will be
required) [48].
On the other hand, Brito et al. [ 49 ], stated that a >3% body mass loss for a period of
less than 48 h affects the competitors’ ability to produce force and the ability to develop
speed. Even if weight loss over several days (5–12) through fluid/food restriction could not
cause performance alterations, a higher percentage of body mass loss could be risky for the
maintenance of athletic performance. Actually, there are studies showing a negative impact
of RWL to anaerobic capacity, maximal strength, power, and high intensity effort repeated
over time up to 24 h after the weight loss [ 34 , 50 – 53 ]. In this regard, combat sports with
higher competition length are more prone to present a real risk of performance alterations
derived from RWL strategies.
Furthermore, Barley et al. [ 22 ] agreed in their study with the establishment of 3–4%
as the limit of weight loss due to dehydration, finding significant differences in physical
(isokinetic strength, perceived fatigue) and physiological parameters (body composition,
resting heart rate, urine and serum osmolality, among others) after a dehydration period.
Moreover, other studies give support to this percentage interval, demonstrating alterations
and decreased values in physical and physiological parameters when applying a higher
%BM loss (~5% or≥9%), such as handgrip strength and muscle power output [ 29 , 30 , 32 – 34 ],
specific sport discipline test [ 36 ], testosterone and insulin levels [ 30 ], as well as alterations
in concentration/level of cortisol, uric acid, and urine density, among other biochemical
parameters [29,30,32,34].
In this line, Kurylas et al. [ 35 ] demonstrated significant impairments in anaerobic
performance when applying a 29-day hypohydration period (~6% body mass loss), showing
lower values in peak and mean power, as well as total work performed (anaerobic capacity).
This could be related to the increment in central temperature, affecting the muscle strength
production sequence. This is mainly through the reduction in motor cortex activation and
the development of peripheral stimulation, in addition to the aforementioned decrease in
power output [54,55].
Within the athletic performance, it is also worth mentioning the influence of RWL
strategies (~4 to≥6% body mass loss) on psychological aspects. Barley et al. [ 22 ] revealed
that a greater loss would lead to cognitive fatigue, directly affecting the performance of the
athletes, and could be maintained over time even after fluid replenishment. In addition,
Barley et al. reported higher scores in perceptions of tension, depression, confusion,
and anger after the dehydration period compared to control group. Similarly, Koral–
Dosseville [ 36 ], Filaire et al. [ 29 ] and Degoutte et al. [ 30 ], reported altered scores in the
profile of mood states dimensions; specifically, a lower score in vigour and increased scores
for tension, fatigue, depression, confusion, and anger were reported.


These statements coincide with the data extracted from the reviews by Lakicevic
et al. [ 5 ], Ceylan et al. [ 6 ], and the study by De Sousa Fortes et al. [ 9 ]. In those studies, a large
weight loss in a short period of time, produced negative effects on psychological aspects
and moods, together with a decrease in metacognitive performance and the possibility of
attenuating attention and anticipation skills, thus affecting decision-making. In the same
line, Camarço et al. [ 32 ] showed significant changes in cognitive tasks, where the number
of mistakes within the tests at any time point was higher in the subject with 9.1% of body
weight loss.
Continuing the line of RWL strategies studied through dehydration, the study by
Moghaddami et al. [ 24 ], added an element of great importance, which is that acute fluid
loss through dry sauna has negative effects on biomechanical parameters, linear and an-
gular maximal velocity, and joint position in elite wrestlers. The maintenance of specific
techniques in professional wrestlers is as important as their strength and endurance ca-
pacity [ 56 ], so ensuring the ability to maintain movements over time is essential, and
weight loss strategies cannot condition their execution under any circumstances. Under a
similar biomechanical perspective, Liu et al. [ 33 ] found that the weight cutting had negative
effects on peripheral nervous system reaction time (concerning the specific limb’s actions)
and accuracy.
Together with the RWL, the present study provides evidence that, according to the
existing scientific literature, a progressive weight loss that combines food and hydra-
tion control strategies does not have a negative influence on performance, something
that is caused by short-term or very short-term weight losses with a more strenuous
percentage of body mass loss [ 36 , 37 ]. Based on this, the contribution of the study by
Matias et al. [ 57 ] should be noted, where it was stated that magnesium supplementation
during weight loss protocols favoured the maintenance of athletes’ performance, as its
loss through sweating is very high and its intake is usually insufficient. Magnesium
supplementation has been shown to be very common in elite sports and of great value
for the maintenance of muscle capacity in athletes, so its application to the world of CS
is amply justified [58].
Related to the importance of weight loss strategies is the relevance of recovery from
weight loss. The recovery period between weight control and competition is usually 24 h
or less, which seems insufficient to regain hydration status, as it affects athletes’ power
values compared to their pre-restriction levels [ 28 , 35 , 59 ]. Indeed, Petterson–Ekström [ 60 ]
could not restore the hydration process completely for the 42% of the studied population,
classified as “severely dehydrated”. Moreover, Barbas et al. [ 21 ] applied a recovery period
of 12 h, where the wrestlers regained only 1.2% body weight. In the same line, Alves
et al. [ 34 ], Carmaço et al. [ 32 ], and Kurylas et al. [ 35 ] (24 h in all cases), attempted to fully
rehydrate the competitors without success. Consequently, this information reveals that a
period >24 to 48 h is necessary in order to complete an adequate rehydration process after
a short-term weight cycling.
However, Fogelholm et al. [ 37 ], stated that a period of between 12 and 14 h is enough
for the athlete to recover after a period of rapid restriction of 59 h, likely demonstrating that
weight losses in very short periods of time can in turn be recovered in very short periods of
time as well.
That being said, as mentioned above, these kind of strategies can clearly be more
detrimental than more progressive ones [ 2 ]. Actually, a very fast (>1 kg·d−^1 ) and/or very
aggressive rehydration (>6%) could provoke performance impairments [ 37 ]. Nor should
it be forgotten that calorie restriction and dehydration are different concepts or strategies
that should not be confused, as well as the feeding back and rehydration processes.


Interestingly, there are competitions lasting more than 1 day, so rehydration process,
weight maintenance, and the accumulation of bouts across the rounds could negatively af-
fect athletic performance. Kraemer et al. [ 28 ], in their study applied to wrestling, stated that
there are physiological and performance decreases due to RWL, and their impact is progres-
sive over 2 days of competition. However, such a claim should be approached with caution,
as the tolerance of CS athletes to weight loss strategies is very high; thus, the changes that
occur could be due to the concomitant accumulation of other stressors (the competition
itself, psychological stress, and the accumulation of bouts during competition) [28,31,61].
In any case, it should be recalled that the compensation period after the RWL is the
time when athletes can refuel and rehydrate, and the duration of this recovery period is
decisive for the performance in subsequent bouts [ 13 ]. This time margin will depend on the
type of event organisation, and there may be a weigh-in prior to the day of the competition
or within the competition day itself, as well as variations in the order of bouts allowing the
athletes a greater or lesser margin for recovery. Concerning this differentiation, the average
number of hours available to competitors in amateur events is usually between 2.5 and 5 h
in the same session/day, being considered insufficient time for the replenishment of food
and hydration. Although extreme methods may prevent a loss of athletic performance, they
may result in an increased tendency to engage in potentially harmful RWL procedures [ 62 ].
Despite the limited number of hours available in amateur competitions, it has been
generally shown that complete rehydration and muscle glycogen replenishment require
at least 48 h, so the common time between weigh-in and competition is not considered
to be enough for the recovery and optimal performance of the athlete [ 10 ]. However,
as Tarnopolsky et al. [ 63 ] have already pointed out, the possibility of achieving partial
rehydration seems possible, achieving improvements in athletic performance (or less
negative effects) in an average replacement time of 17 h.
In any case, some authors [ 64 ] suggest that observed windows of 32 h for recov-
ery could promote aggressive “weight-making” strategies, involving a clear risk to an
athlete’s well-being.
Lastly, the scientific literature shows that RWL methodologies are more effective
and behave differently in male compared to female athletes, which should be taken into
consideration among athletes and coaches [ 7 ]. Koral–Dosseville [ 36 ] found differences
between genders after a RWL strategy intervention, where higher values for squat jump,
countermovement jump, and mean power were found in male athletes. However, male
competitors had greater losses in countermovement jump, mean power, and the specific
judo test for 30 s.
In this context, it should be pointed out that the number of female competitors in
combat sports has increased considerably in the last few years, and there has been a growing
interest in the research community. In fact, studies in other sports disciplines or contexts
highlight the importance of analysing the relationship between the practice of this type of
weight loss strategies and physical and physiological performance parameters, especially
when analysed together with the menstrual cycle as a variable to consider [ 65 , 66 ]. Last but
not least, the scientific literature argues for more gender balance in sports science research.

**5. Conclusions**

After analysing the studies on the effects of RWL in CS on the athletic performance
from physical, physiological, and psychological perspectives, the current systematic review
can be assured that the most advisable RWL methodology to guarantee the athletic per-
formance of the competitor in general terms should not exceed 3% to≤5% of total body
weight loss, followed by≥24 h hours for rehydration after the weigh-in in order to have an
adequate recovery (at least partially, since the common timing between weigh-in and the
competition is ~1 day). This could be within acceptable limits for competition, assuming
no or minimal decrease in athletic performance, and probably being compensated by the
competitive advantage of fighting in a lower weight category.


```
Concerning the time needed to perform such RWL, a progressive weight loss over
several weeks is recommended, being even more relevant in competitions lasting several
days and involving multiple bouts or qualifying rounds. On the other hand, the big
question remains whether the benefit of downgrading and competing against a “smaller”
opponent outweighs the costs and risks of a possible reduction in athletic performance due
to drastic RWL strategies.
Despite all this and its widespread use among CS athletes, it is important to highlight
the need to raise awareness among coaches about avoiding these types of weight control
programmes in youth athletes, as they could have a negative effect on their development
and affect their hormonal balance [38].
Finally, it is important to consider the possible limitations found in this research. The
most relevant is the implementation of almost all the programmes only in male athletes
(15 out of 16 studies), whereby the results obtained may differ from those applicable to
female wrestlers. In addition, no ethnic identity was reported in the selected studies, which
could be a parameter to take into consideration in new original studies when implementing
this type of strategies.
