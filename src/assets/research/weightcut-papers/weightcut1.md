ABSTRACT
Following an extensive literature review, the International
Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official
position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat
sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp,
and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influ-
encing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16
points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the
Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports
have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and
competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and
weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the
duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of
the aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic
pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-
output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation
phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to
15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements
including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-
methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance
performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, com-
petition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic

decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient long-
itudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be deter-
mined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such
as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prior-
itized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean
body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports
training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the
following: carbohydrates 3.0–4.0 g/kg, protein 1.2–2.0 g/kg, and
fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range
from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to
weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective
for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight
week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through
exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2%
loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber
intake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute
water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion,
and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate
supervision (optimally ~2–4% of body mass within 24 h of
weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are
utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition
with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral
rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with
a sodium range of 50–90 mmol/dL should take precedence
immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at
a tolerable rate of ≤ 60 g/h should follow oral rehydration
solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to
avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate
intake at 8–12 g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes
that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies dur-
ing fight week. About 4–7 g/kg may be suitable for modest
carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refuel-
ing protocols should aim to regain ≥10% of body mass to
mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of
rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight
cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating
further research.

#### 1. Methods

This position stand focuses on nutritional recommendations that are specific to MMA and
combat sports. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using three databases:
PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. The following combination of search terms were
used for each individual database: combat sports, acute weight cut strategies, bioener-
getics, fiber depletion, heat acclimation, water loading, glycogen status, hydration, sports
nutrition, and nutrient timing. Articles were included if they were peer-reviewed and/or
original research. Although few published studies address the complexities and unique
training demands of combat sports, relevant articles were selected, regardless of any
methodological limitations. The studies were categorized based on the core phases of
combat sports: general preparation/off camp, fight camp, fight week, and rehydration/
refueling.

#### 2. Introduction

Combat sports have a long history, yet organized scientific study is still in its infancy.
Several combat-related sports can be traced back to the ancient Olympic games: includ-
ing armored foot races, boxing, wrestling, and throwing events. These combat sports
known as “pankration” entered the 33rd Greek Olympic Games circa 688 BCE [ 1 ]. Over the
centuries, various disciplines evolved from the ancient art of pankration, such as wrestling,
judo, kickboxing, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai, and now two of the world’s more popular
combat sports: Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and Brazilian jiu Jitsu. The recent growth and
global interest in combat sports and MMA can be largely attributed to the establishment
of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993 [ 2 ]. Currently, in its 31st year, the
UFC is estimated to generate over a billion dollars per year [ 3 , 4 ]. Furthermore, the UFC has
facilitated the growth of numerous other MMA organizations and has also increased
interest in other combat sport disciplines like Brazilian jiu-jitsu [ 5 ]. With the increasing
popularity of the sport, higher participation rates, and greater earning potential, coaches
and fighters are motivated to improve skill acquisition and enhance their physiological
capacities. Recognizing the needs of modern combat athletes, the UFC Performance
Institute was established specifically to offer evidence-based services in strength and
conditioning, testing, nutrition counseling, weight cut supervision, post weigh-in rehy-
dration and refueling strategies, and post-fight recovery.
The intent of this position statement is to review existing literature on combat sport
disciplines, with a specific focus on identifying best practices for general preparation, fight
camp/longitudinal weight descent, fight week, post weigh-in recovery, and post-fight
health and well-being. While there is ample research available on optimal dietary prac-
tices for athletes in various sports, there is a noticeable lack of data specifically tailored to
combat sports. This is particularly true when it comes to determining the most effective
practices for longitudinal weight descent during fight camp, fight week preparation, and
post weigh-in recovery. As a result, this position statement places special emphasis on
mixed martial arts (MMA), where combat athletes have a pre-day weigh-in. Consequently,
the recovery period after a weigh-in can range from 24 to 36 h before the fighter enters
the cage, mat, or ring. However, consideration is also given to sports, such as Brazilian jiu-
jitsu, and wrestling, where weigh-ins occur less than 24 h before or on the same day as the
competition, often with only a 1–2 h window between stepping off the scale and
competing on the mat.

#### 3. Professional overview

Combat sports and MMA present numerous variables to consider when formulating
nutritional strategies, including both foreseeable and unforeseen factors. For example,
the bioenergetics and energy requirements across MMA and combat sports disciplines are
largely commensurate with the phases of preparation, and the athletes’ total body mass.
Factors such as weight class, training styles, volumes, and intensities, may necessitate
individualized adjustments with dietary planning. The preparation requirements, duration
of competitions, and weigh-in regulations will vary across fight disciplines [ 6 ]. In MMA,
exceedingly high training volumes are necessary due to the interdisciplinary nature of the
sport, where different styles must be trained concomitantly [ 3 ]. MMA fighters must

```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 3
```

possess sound techniques in punching, kicking, wrestling, jiu jitsu, and Muay Thai. This
leads to potential increases in training volume and intensities, which in turn influence
energy and recovery demands. It is essential to differentiate between the bioenergetics
and energy demands of training for competition vs. the competition itself. For example, at
the professional level, most MMA fights consist of three rounds lasting 5 min each, with
a 1-min rest interval between rounds. In contrast, fight preparation can involve four to
5 h a day of intensive training [ 3 ].
It is also critical to consider that nutritional strategies during camp may need to be
managed according to the weigh-in regulations of the sport (Table 1 ). In general, both
amateur and professional MMA, boxing, kickboxing, and Olympic judo offer 24-to-36-h
windows between the weigh-in and the time the athlete enters the cage, mat, or ring.
Most national, international, and Olympic competitions (e.g. wrestling and Brazilian jiu
jitsu) require the athlete to weigh-in less than 24 h before a match, or on the same day,
often with only 1–2 h to recover before competition. These weigh-in windows will require
different methods for each athlete to reach their competitive weight. MMA, boxing, and
kickboxing emphasize reducing body fat and relying on rapid weight loss and acute water
loss techniques in the final 24–48 h before the weigh-in. This is immediately followed by
replenishing fluids, electrolytes, and an emphasis on carbohydrate intake in the subse-
quent 24–36-h window. In contrast, other combat sports have a smaller recovery window
of 1–2 h. This is an extremely important differentiating factor as those combat athletes
with a 1–2-h recovery time will not be able to deploy the same type of acute water loss
strategies and rehydration practices as those with longer recovery windows. Hence,
athletes competing with same-day weigh-ins such as wrestling or jiu jitsu may need to
have a greater reliance on the loss of body fat and regulation of lean tissue mass to qualify

for their competition as the window for rapid weight loss, acute water loss and rehydra-
tion, is limited. Nutritional and weight cut strategies are reviewed throughout this paper
with a specific focus on practices for those disciplines with a longer weigh-in and recovery
time such as MMA. However, the following considerations are addressed for those with
combat disciplines with different post-weigh-in recovery times (Table 1 ).

#### 4. Bioenergetics

Three energy systems intersect to initiate and regulate the generation of adenosine tripho-
sphate (ATP): the adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine (i.e. ATP-PCr or phosphagen)
system, the glycolytic (lactic acid or fast glycolysis) system, and the oxidative systems (i.e.
aerobic or oxygen) [ 7 ]. The ATP-PCr and glycolytic systems are considered anaerobic, while the
oxidative system is known to be aerobic. The ATP-PCr system is metabolically powerful due to
the rapid transfer of energy in a brief time frame. The glycolytic system provides energy
through the body’s digestion of carbohydrates; however, this process is more metabolically
costly. Lastly, the oxidative energy system utilizes oxygen to break down carbohydrates, fats,
and, in times of high metabolic demands or low energy availability, proteins. Each of these
energy systems offers a differing amount of energy release and is intensity dependent [ 7 ].
Recognizing the role of each energy system in a specific sport is essential for adequately
preparing athletes to optimize their performance during competitions through effective
dietary practices, supplementation, training, and recovery protocols see Table 2 [ 8 ].
Combat athletes not only require elevated levels of cardiorespiratory endurance for
sustained performance, but also need explosive knockout power for striking, as well as the
necessary strength for effective takedowns and manipulation of their opponents [ 9 ].
Determining the exact energy systems and fuel mixtures in real-time is challenging as
attaching accurate metabolic measuring devices to the athlete is likely to hinder perfor-
mance or pose a risk of injury. Simulated fight scenarios in a laboratory setting partially
address this issue through the measurement of effort-pause ratios. By using effort-pause

ratios, one can infer the physiological and metabolic demands of the fight and differ-
entiate between combat athletes with varying training levels and fighting styles. Research
conducted in simulated fight bouts across different fight disciplines has provided valuable
insights into the energy systems and substrate utilization.

#### 4.1. Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)

MMA requires extremely high energy metabolic demands, and it does so across all three
energy systems. The sport may be best categorized as “a high-intensity intermittent sport
in which force must be repeatedly exerted against an external resistance in the form of an
opponent” [ 3 ].
The bioenergetic demands of MMA require managing the mixing of the alactic, fast
glycolytic, and aerobic energy systems. Previous work comparing high-level and low-level
martial artists showed that successful grappling- and striking-focused athletes have
greater anaerobic energy system(s) efforts [10–15]. The variations in anaerobic output
(ATP-PCR vs Glycolytic) between strikers and grapplers underscore the differences in
work-rest ratios inherent in their respective sports, but other factors such as the pace of
a fight/match could exert influence. In striking combat sports, Muay Thai and kickboxing
exhibited work-to-rest ratios of 2:3 and 1:2, respectively, which aligns with the character-
istics of the ATP-PCR energy system [ 16 ]. In grappling sports, such as judo, a greater work-
to-rest ratio has been measured at 3:1, which is suggestive of the glycolytic energy system
[ 17 ]. Similarly, a 3:1 ratio was identified in Greco-Roman wrestling [ 18 ]. The work-to-rest
ratios of both striking and grappling sports rely heavily on the anaerobic system for high-
intensity periods while oxidative pathways contribute to the recovery of anaerobic
activity. The larger work-to-rest ratio seen in grappling sports explains the longer-term
and longer-bouts of anaerobic efforts seen among high-level grapplers [ 19 , 20 ]. The work-
to-rest ratio in MMA has been measured between 1:2 and 1:4 (excluding intervals
between rounds), which is midway between striking and grappling sports and displays
a combination of both ATP-PCR and glycolytic anaerobic energy system contributions
[ 21 , 22 ]. While bouts lasting 15 to 25-min demand a heightened level of cardiorespiratory
fitness (i.e. oxidative energy system), MMA athletes attempt to deliver impactful strikes or
engage in grappling and wrestling which may necessitate a superior degree of strength,
power, and muscular endurance. In other words, the outcome of a fight in MMA can be
decided by the ability to optimally engage in intermittent bursts of maximal exertion
within brief time frames.
In title fight bouts, MMA athletes compete for a maximum of 25 min (5 × 5-min rounds).
Each round may consist of high-intensity periods of action lasting from 6 to 36 s [ 23 ]. This
is combined with episodes of lower-intensity action that may last two to three times as
long. Notably, however, knockouts and TKOs occur in these high-intensity areas of
activity, making these explosive efforts critical to success [ 3 ]. Moreover, the MMA athlete’s
metabolic capacity may be influenced by factors such as the demands of the weight cut,
post weigh-in recovery, the pace of the fight, the fighting styles, and which opponent is
dictating the style and pace of the fight. Hence, numerous factors will influence the
energy requirements of MMA training or competition. No studies to date have accurately
measured the caloric expenditure of full-training sessions or a mock three-round fight.
Research across various combat sport disciplines has mostly focused on Olympic sports.

6 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


Although the translation of findings from other combat sport disciplines may not offer
exact parallels to the bioenergetic demands of an MMA match, it does offer valuable
insights into the caloric expenditure and distribution of energy system utilization.

#### 4.2. Karate

During the 2020 Olympic Games, karate was one of the striking sports that was
represented [ 24 ]. Beneke et al. [ 25 ] used excess post-exercise oxygen consumption
(EPOC) and blood lactate measures during a simulated fight to analyze karate
athletes. After 36 matches, consisting of 2–4 fights per athlete with a mean duration
of 275 ± 61 s and 9-,15-, and 17-min intervals between matches, it was demonstrated
that these fights had 77.8 ± 5.8% contribution from the oxidative system, 16.0 ± 4.6%
from the ATP-PCr system, and 6.2 ± 2.4% from the glycolytic system. The total
observed energy expenditure was 81.4 ± 19.5 kcals. These findings suggest that
during a karate fight, athletes rely predominantly on oxidative metabolism while
still receiving support from anaerobic systems. Beneke et al. [ 25 ] concluded that
athletes who were most efficient at utilizing the ATP-PCr energy system were the
most effective at executing actions during the fight and those who maintained
glycolytic power throughout the fight made the most offensive actions. In agree-
ment, Doria et al. [ 26 ] also showed that the oxidative system (74 ± 1%) was the
predominant energy system in karate. The researchers observed that the ATP-PCr
system contributed 14 ± 3% and the glycolytic system contributed 12 ± 2% during
a karate match, with a total expenditure of 72.8 kcals ±6 kcals. During this study,
they also compared sex differences and found that males relied more on oxidative
contributions when compared to females.
Loturco et al. [ 27 ] completed a case study on a male karate athlete, who is a double
world champion, the athlete performed a simulated karate bout. Their findings again
aligned with the previous work of Beneke and Doria in that they reported an energy
expenditure of 88.5 kcals, 31% of energy production was derived from the glycolytic
system while the oxidative system contributed 61%.

#### 4.3. Taekwondo

Campos et al. [ 28 ] reported a 66 ± 6% contribution from the oxidative system, 30 ± 6%
contribution from ATP-PCr, and 4 ± 2% from the glycolytic system in taekwondo athletes
during a simulated match. In each round, there was a mean expenditure of 43 ± 7 kcal. In
addition, the contribution of energy systems varied in each round. In round one, the
oxidative system (23 ± 3 kcal) compared to round 2 (30 ± 3 kcal) and round 3 (32 ± 4 kcal).
The contribution from the glycolytic system also decreased from the first round (2.6 ± 0.
kcal) to the third round (1.5 ± 1.1 kcal). The first round required less energy expenditure
(38 ± 4 kcal) compared to the second (43 ± 4 kcal) and third (49 ± 7 kcal) rounds. To
maintain the same level of technical action, the athletes expend more energy in the
later rounds than in the first, which indicates a decrease in efficiency. The only overall
change in energy systems was a lower contribution from the glycolytic system in the first
round (7 ± 2%) versus the last round (3 ± 3%). The ATP-PCr system had an equal contribu-
tion across all three rounds, indicating that the 1-min interval of rest was sufficient for

```

replenishing phosphocreatine stores. The high energy demand in taekwondo is mainly
met by the ATP-PCr system, which provides energy to sustain repeated striking attacks
involving both the upper and lower body [ 28 ].

#### 4.4. Judo

Julio et. al. [ 29 ] examined the energy system contribution in grappling sports. During this
study, the authors reported that the oxidative system contributed 70%, while the ATP-PCr
system contributed 21% and the glycolytic system provided 8% of the energy needed
during the match duration. Their total energy expenditure was 84 ± 22 kcal. By assessing
the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) and VO 2 Peak for upper and lower body
cycle ergometry, they observed some shifts in metabolic systems. During a match, the
energy consumption of a judo athlete appears to be between their VO 2 Peak and their
OBLA. The researchers found a lower oxidative system contribution in 1-, 2-, and 3-min
matches compared to those of longer duration. The shorter matches showed a greater
reliance on the ATP-PCr system, and longer matches used greater oxidative contributions.
The glycolytic system remained constant throughout the length of the matches. Power
was seen to be notably higher while rest time was lower in the 1-min matches compared
to the longer matches. This indicates that nutritional and training interventions should be
aimed at maintaining metabolic power over time to improve performance.

#### 4.5. Boxing

Davis et al. [ 30 ] simulated an Olympic boxing match consisting of three rounds, each
lasting 3 min. They showed that the oxidative system contributed 86% to energy produc-
tion while ATP-PCr contributed 10%, and the glycolytic system contributed 4%. The
boxers were reported to be at 97–100% of their VO2Peak during the last 20 s of each
round. The contribution of the oxidative energy system was lowest during the 1st round
(30 ± 4.8 kcal) compared to the 2nd and 3rd rounds (33.8 ± 5.7 kcal and 33.6 ± 6.8 kcal,
respectively), while the glycolytic system was highest during the 1st round (3.2 ± 0.9 kcal)
with concomitant decreases for the 2nd and 3rd round (1.9 ± 0.6 kcal and 1 ± 0.8 kcal,
respectively). Interestingly, the boxers were able to maintain the same total number of
offensive attacks per round. The authors suggest the energy demands are slightly lower
compared to a competitive bout which would shift metabolic demands to slightly more
anerobic but still predominantly aerobic. However, Davis et al. [ 30 ] concluded that these
physiological and energy system responses to the boxing match indicate that the athletes
were metabolically efficient, and they exhibited a high level of aerobic fitness, as seen by
their ability to supply ATP through oxidative pathways rather than glycolytic flux during
the rounds.

#### 4.6. Muay Thai

Crisafulli et al. [ 31 ] examined ten experienced competitive Muay Thai athletes during
a simulated match consisting of three rounds (3 min per round) with a 1-min rest period
between rounds. This is consistent with many amateur Muay Thai bouts. The investigation
showed that the average heart rate and oxygen uptake for all athletes were above those

respective values when evaluated at lactate threshold for all three rounds. However, even
though the heart rate and oxygen consumption slightly decreased during the 1-min
period between rounds, they remained above the lactate threshold and thus did not
allow for full recovery. The athletes’ efforts beyond levels of aerobic metabolism produced
increases in CO 2 production because of the body’s shift toward anaerobic processes,
which is intricately linked to the observed rise in blood lactate. This indicates a meaningful
relationship between the two. This also served as an indirect index of glycolysis. The
researchers showed that after an initial increase, the excess CO 2 peaked in the first round
and subsequent rest period, and there was a continual increase on the reliance of the
aerobic system. Therefore, glycolysis predominated early in the match and then progres-
sively waned as the contribution of the aerobic system increased in the following
rounds [ 20 ].

#### 4.7. Jiu jitsu/wrestling

Wrestling, submission grappling, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu are commonly integral parts
of an MMA match, yet this can be contingent on the disciplines and styles of the
fighters competing. The sport of wrestling is likely to place a significant demand on
all energy systems. Ohya et al. [ 32 ], purported that the technical and tactical
requirements of wrestling, coupled with the muscle-strength andpower demands
on both the upper and lower body, foster the use of both the anaerobic and
aerobic energy systems. The anaerobic system provides the quick bursts of maximal
power during the match, whereas the aerobic system contributes to the wrestler’s
ability to maintain effort for the duration of the match and to recover between
periods [ 32 ].
A study by Mirzaei et al. [ 33 ] investigated the energy systems in Greco-Roman and
Freestyle wrestlers participating in the 2015 and 2016 World Championships. Energy
contributions remain comparable across weight classes in both the Freestyle and
Greco-Roman wrestlers [ 33 ]. The study found that glycolytic/lactic acid system con-
tributed the most in energy release during a single wrestling match, which repre-
sents the anaerobic nature of wrestling. Additionally, the results showed that the
nature of Freestyle is more dynamic than Greco Roman, because Freestyle wrestlers
can use all the Greco-Roman techniques as well as leg attacks by using arms and
legs actively. Indeed, Kraemer et al. [ 34 ] reported that large increases in lactate (up
to 20 mmol/L) occurred during a five-minute college freestyle match, which is
associated with reductions in power production and fatigue. In contrast, the authors
of this review cited that maximal treadmill tests only raise lactate to approximately
10 mmol/L.
However, factors such as the duration and intensity of the match, skill level, level of
competition, and movement efficiency may significantly influence the relative contribu-
tion of each system. Accordingly, determining the precise contribution of each energy
system in wrestling matches remains challenging.
A recent study by Pessoa Filho et al. [ 35 ] investigated the metabolic demands of
a single six-minute no-gi sparring match with 10 advanced no-gi grapplers. Their inves-
tigation reported approximately 28% of energy contribution was derived from the ATP-
PCr, and approximately 72% was derived from anaerobic energy contributions. While the

investigators did not measure aerobic contributions, they asserted that matches of
sustained lengths would have a greater reliance on aerobic metabolism. The authors
also noted that differences in the style of an individual jiu jitsu competitor, the level of
competition, perceived stress, and opponent effort, potentially influenced energetic
pathway utilization.

#### 4.7.1. Bioenergetics summary

In summary, combat sports involve high-intensity actions that are metabolically demand-
ing, so athletes must have good metabolic flexibility and efficiency. Research on martial
arts has generally found that the energy demands of an average karate fight lasting 4 min
and 27 s come from aerobic (77.8%), anaerobic alactic (16.0%), and lactic (6.2%) energy
pathways [ 25 ]. Moreover, the existing research is consistent; independent of the combat
sport discipline, as the duration of the match increases, the contribution of the aerobic
system increases, yet anaerobic alactic pathways remain vital for executing high output
bursts of skill applications. It is important to note that sports nutrition professionals
should be aware of the numerous factors that can influence energetic demands, energy
expenditure, and ultimately metabolic cost. With an understanding of the complex
interaction of energy systems, sports nutrition professionals can effectively manage the
total daily energy expenditure requirements based on the combat athletes training
volumes, intensities, and body composition, and adjust the calories and macronutrients,
as necessary.

#### 5. Combat sports – preparation phases

As noted, combat sports are a group of contact activities in which fighters engage in one-
on-one physical contests depending on a specific set of rules for competition. Combat
athletes can strike, kick, hit, throw, punch, or grapple with their opponent, depending on
the ruleset, with the aim of trying to score more points by disabling their rivals and
stopping them from continuing the match [ 36 ]. The physical stresses of combat athletes
are highly individualized and vary based on the demands of their training specialty
(jujitsu/boxing/grappling), weight class, and the timing of the next match. Phases of
combat sports are generally separated into three distinct phases: “Off camp” or general
preparation, “fight camp” and “fight week”/post weigh-in. General preparation is com-
monly referred to as “off camp.” As the name implies, this phase occurs between fights
and outside of a formalized fight camp. This phase should focus on improving aerobic
capacity, advancing skills, developing strength and power, and maintaining an appro-
priate body mass and body composition. Fight camps, on the other hand, are eight-to-ten
-week periods of time where the fighter works extensively on advancing multidisciplinary
skills that target tactical strategies, and specifically advancing the requisite bio-motor
qualities needed to be successful in competition. This often involves two to three daily
training sessions, which are done commensurate with the longitudinal weight descent.
Finally, fight week requires the fighters, coaches, and sports nutrition professionals to
strategically manage skill sessions and manipulate nutritional and weight cut strategies,
which include adjusting caloric intake, carbohydrate reductions, and water loading.
Additionally, fighters utilize acute water loss strategies such as dry sauna, hot water

10 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


immersion, and mummy wraps. At the professional level, many of these practices during
fight week must be managed with numerous press and media obligations.

#### 5.1 Off camp/general – preparation phase

The “off camp” phase occurs between fights and precedes the formalized fight camp. This
phase, which can vary in length, should focus on advancing aerobic capacity, technical
skills, developing strength and power, and maintaining an appropriate body mass and
body composition.

#### 5.1.1. Body mass and weight

Combat athletes may benefit from maintaining adequate levels of aerobic fitness along
with managing their body mass and body composition during the general preparation
phase; especially as it pertains to health and performance. In this respect, an athlete’s
“walk-around weight” is an important metric outside of fight camp. Walk-around weight is
generally defined as the athlete’s weight outside of the fight camp measured against their
weight class. It is estimated that combat athletes lose an average of 5% body mass during
rapid weight loss [ 37 ]. Garthe et al. [ 38 ] reported minimal losses in performance measures
(1-repetition-maximum (1RM) tests, 40-m sprint, and countermovement jump) in indivi-
duals engaged in weight loss at rates of 0.7% per week. Based on typical loss during RWL
and weekly body mass loss of 0.5–1% over an 8-week camp, the authors suggest that the
ideal maximum walk-around weight should range from 12% to 15% above the athlete’s
desired weight class. The authors speculate this will minimize decreases in performance
while allowing the athlete to make the weight of their desired class. In context, this would
have a UFC male middleweight, required to make 185Ibs for their weight division,
sustaining a weight of 207Ibs–212Ibs in the off camp phase. However, these numbers
have not yet been fully substantiated through research and while there is scant research
on this notion, practical application suggests this range should be effective for
a longitudinal weight descent that simultaneously supports conditioning, skill training,
and recovery. During fight camp, the athlete will utilize dietary and exercise strategies
that create a caloric deficit to decrease body mass and must ensure this deficit does not
negatively impact training performance, overall health, and any potentially harmful long-
term metabolic adaptations. Although 12–15% may be potentially optimal, larger reduc-
tions in body mass are common practice in combat sports [ 39 ].
Moreover, research has shown large decreases in testosterone below clinical reference
ranges (<5 mmol·L−1), as well as a decrease in resting metabolic rate, when losing 13–15%
body mass over an 8-week camp [ 40 ]. Accordingly, the ranges of 12–15% body mass
above the weight class may be the upper limits of a suitable longitudinal weight descent.
Combat athletes exceeding 12–15% body mass will require more significant energy
restriction, and if completed over a shorter duration than 8 weeks, the caloric deficit
needed to achieve the desired changes in body mass may put athletes at a greater risk for
low energy availability. While much of the available literature on low energy availability
has indicated systemic reductions in various hormones, the impact of these energy
deficits may also result in negative changes related to skill acquisition, concentration,
motivation, and recovery [ 41 ]. This is a critical area for future research, which aims to

```

```

identify suitable losses in body mass that will allow for sustained longitudinal health and
performance for combat athletes.

#### 5.1.2 Energy requirements and macronutrients

Like many other types of athletes, the success of combat athletes is highly
dependent on their ability to consume adequate energy to meet the demands of
multiple daily training sessions. Daily energy needs are based on the athlete’s body
mass, body composition, training volumes, goal weight, and total daily energy
expenditure (TDEE). The caloric needs of elite combat athletes engaged in moder-
ate to high-intensity training differ significantly from those of the general popula-
tion. To maintain weight, athletes must balance caloric intake with total energy
expenditure, so determining TDEE with reasonable accuracy is necessary. Metabolic
carts and indirect calorimetry are the most accurate methods to determine
a combat athlete’s resting metabolic rate (RMR). In the absence of these modalities,
total energy expenditure can be calculated using the Mifflin – St Jeor equation,
which considers age (years), sex, height (cm), weight (kg), and an estimate of the
athlete’s physical activity level (PAL) [ 42 , 43 ]. The Cunningham equation can also be
used which determines BMR via, BMR (kcal/day) = 500 + 22 × (lean body mass). The
Cunningham equation determines the energy required at rest by considering lean
body mass instead of overall body weight and then factoring in the combat
athlete’s physical activity level. Another simple estimate of total energy expendi-
ture is to multiply the athlete’s weight (lbs.) by 14 and add the estimated calories
burned by training and the thermic effect of food [ 43 ], which is typically 3% to
10% of calorie expenditure [ 44 ]. These methods provide a reasonable estimate for
caloric expenditure which should then be adjusted to best match the combat
athletes’ current body mass, training demands, and for the maintenance of
a desired weight and body composition.
Combat athletes meet their caloric requirements by consuming adequate amounts of
carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Carbohydrate requirements vary significantly based on
body mass, the type of workout, training intensity, and the training phase in which they
are engaged [ 43 ]. Generally, combat athletes should anticipate consuming between 3 to
5 g of carbohydrates per kg of body mass daily for light activity and between 8 to 12 g of
carbohydrates per kg of body mass daily for intense training [ 43 ]. Although research
suggests 8–12 g of carbohydrate per kg of body mass may be required for endurance
athletes, this amount is likely to be excessive for combat athletes competing in
a weight-specific sport. However, one should not overestimate the merit of consuming
these amounts for post weigh-in refueling. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, sweet
potatoes, rice, pasta, and legumes are recommended sources of carbohydrates during
the “off camp” phase, instead of processed sugars [ 43 ].
Fat requirements for the combat athlete are the same as nonathletes and should be
20–35% of total daily calories or approximately 1.0 g of fat for every kilogram of body
mass per day. While being the most energy-dense nutrient, dietary fat is a common target
for people who need to restrict energy intake; however, consuming daily fat intake below
15–20% of total calorie intake is not advised [ 45 ]. However, fats are often restricted during
longitudinal weight descents to meet the restriction in calories while preserving carbohy-
drate and protein intakes. Optimal fat sources include salmon, lean meats, eggs, nuts and

12 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


nut butters, avocado, coconut, and olive oil [ 43 ], and not saturated or trans fats from fried
foods, processed cheeses, or hydrogenated oil.
Protein requirements range from a minimum of 1.2 g per kg of body mass per day and
up to 2.4 g of protein per kg of body mass or 15% to 30% of total calories [ 43 ] which is
a higher intake relative to the average sedentary individual [ 46 , 47 ]. In addition to promot-
ing muscle recovery and enhancing muscle protein synthesis, increased protein intake
results in favorable changes in body composition, especially when in an energy deficit. It is
imperative to meet protein requirements since, unlike fats and carbohydrates, there is
a limited storage pool of proteins and their constituent amino acids. If combat athletes are
not meeting protein requirements via sufficient food intake, protein supplementation in
the form of protein powders or ready to drink beverages might be needed to achieve
adequate energy and protein needs. The sports nutrition professional can assist combat
athletes in building proper meals that meet energy and macronutrient demands, with
strategically timed windows around their training sessions.
Although micronutrients are considered essential for optimum health, their ability to
function as ergogenic aids is unlikely [ 43 ], mainly when overt deficiency was present
before vitamin and mineral supplementation. Nonetheless, studies have highlighted that
consuming a multivitamin can help athletes meet their daily micronutrient needs, which
are higher compared to the general population [ 48 ].

#### 5.1.3. Periodized nutrition

Another emerging area of research is “periodized nutrition,” which refers to the strategic
use of specific nutritional interventions to support exercise performance [ 49 ]. This is not
a new concept. It is well established that protein should be consumed post-exercise, as
this can optimize net protein synthesis. However, most nutritional recommendations for
athletes aim to promote acute recovery after exercise and are not specific regarding the
type of training or intensity [ 49 ]. Pairing specific nutritional goals commensurate with the
phases of training may be beneficial for the combat athlete whose nutritional needs
extend beyond recovery [ 49 ]. For example, protein needs should be based on increasing
or maintaining a suitable body composition in the general preparation phase. Moreover,
protein needs should be tailored to recovery and minimizing loss of lean body mass
during fight camp. The authors recommend creating individualized nutrition and training
programs, ideally before the start of fight camp, and adjusting as needed.

#### 5.1.4. Assessment

Prior to entering fight camp, it is important to conduct a thorough assessment of the
specific demands of the combat sport discipline and the individual athlete’s needs. An
assessment enables the training team to determine which nutritional strategies should be
implemented for the combat athlete and what needs to be achieved before fight camp.
Information such as the athlete’s anthropometrics, previous weight cut practices, the
number and duration of weight cuts, and current dietary intake (including supplementa-
tion) should be assessed. Daily food logs or dietary tracking apps are accessible to most
individuals and are ideal for assessing and monitoring dietary intake. The combat athletes’
previous practices can be measured against an evidence-based approach and revised
when warranted.

While there are numerous measures that may have utility in optimizing performance
through nutritional interventions. The sports nutrition professional may be most con-
cerned with data including resting metabolic rate (RMR), body composition including fat-
free mass (FFM), body fat percentage, and total body water (TBW). First, this data may
assist in developing nutrition strategies that will meet the energy demands for combat
athletes through all phases of training. Additionally, via determining total body mass and
fat-free mass, predictive equations can be used to establish the feasibility of the combat
athlete competing in their weight division. While there are no specific validated equations
for predicting the efficiency and safety of longitudinal weight descents, the UFC
Performance Institute has developed the Weight Making Preparedness Score (WMPS).
The equation requires data on Fat-Free Mass, the athlete’s Total Mass over the target
weight, Fat Mass, and Resting Metabolic Rate. The equation can be found on pp. 242 of
the Cross-Sectional Performance Analysis of the UFC Athlete, vol. 2.
This data may also have utility for determining the required rate of a longitudinal
weight descent in fight camp; and for monitoring any potential deviances in resting
metabolic rate. Accordingly, the sports nutrition professional may track these measures
(body composition and resting metabolic rate) and adjust nutritional strategies as needed
to ensure adequate energy intake and an efficient longitudinal weight descent.
There are various methods available for testing body composition, which can be used
by researchers and trainers. Common methodologies for measuring body composition
include hydro-densitometry, air displacement plethysmography, multifrequency bioelec-
trical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), ultrasound, 3D scanning, skinfold thickness, and dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [ 50 ] Each method has its own strengths and weak-
nesses, as assessed by researchers. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is considered
one of the most accurate methods for assessing body composition. DXA provides infor-
mation on total and regional fat mass, fat-free mass, percent fat, and bone mineral density
[ 51 ]. Additionally, DXA can provide limb-specific estimations of fat mass and fat-free mass,
which is useful for measuring and tracking injury/recovery and fat loss for weight cutting
[ 52 , 53 ]. Essential DXA measurements for combat athletes include body composition
analysis, muscle-fat analysis, and obesity analysis. It should be noted that DXA, as with
all modalities, is subject to confounding results from inter-assessment differences in
hydration, glycogen and muscle creatine levels, all which can vary significantly in combat
athletes [ 54 ].
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an inexpensive and reliable assessment tool
used for body composition. Unlike DXA, BIA estimates total body water, which can be
useful for estimating the impact of fluid loss on pre- and post-training and pre- and post-
weight-in. Important BIA measurements to consider in combat athletes are body compo-
sition analysis, muscle-fat analysis, and obesity analysis. Compared to DXA, BIA has been
shown to underestimate fat mass and overestimate fat-free mass [ 51 ,55–60]. Despite this
variability in findings with BIA, it can still be considered a useful tool for measuring body
composition change, which is especially important for sports nutrition professionals
assessing directional change [ 51 , 55 , 61 ].
As part of a comprehensive assessment, when possible, blood analysis screenings may
provide insight into a combat athlete’s health and performance. Blood work is often used
as a screening tool to identify potential deficiencies in vitamins, minerals and micromin-
erals such as iron, as well as evaluating oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally,

14 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


blood work can provide the status of red blood cell populations as well as markers such as
cortisol and creatine kinase, which can provide insights into overtraining, readiness to
train, and other measures such as protein turnover [ 62 ]. Biomarkers such as vitamin D and
iron are well established and commonly assessed, whereas others need further research
(e.g. fatty acids) to demonstrate their utility in sport [ 62 ]. Newer methods that estimate
plasma volume using groups of biochemical markers are also showing promise. Such
markers may provide additional support for monitoring a combat athlete’s adaptation to
training.

#### 5.1.5. Performance supplementation

Supplementation with various dietary ingredients is a widespread practice for many
athletes to heighten performance and augment training adaptations. While research on
combat sport athletes is limited, some evidence is available which suggests certain
ingredients may enhance their performance. The phase of training or preparation
whereby an athlete may choose to utilize a certain dietary supplement is an important
consideration. For many supplements, utilizing them during a general preparation phase
is a prudent consideration. This allows for experimenting with a given supplement and
the dosing to optimize the effects on the combat athlete. Some supplements, however,
rely on their accumulation in skeletal muscle (e.g. creatine, beta-alanine, etc.) to exert their
ergogenic effects. In these situations, the off-camp/general preparation phase allows for
a sufficient window of time for these supplements to reach ergogenic levels.
Notwithstanding these considerations, the following supplements may be considered
for their ability to augment performance and recovery potential of combat athletes:
Caffeine [ 63 ], beta-alanine [ 64 ], sodium bicarbonate [ 65 ], creatine [ 66 ], and nitrates
[ 67 , 68 ]. In addition, supplements such as essential amino acids [ 69 ], leucine [ 70 ], [ 71 ],
branched-chain amino acids [72–74], and β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyrate [ 75 ], may promote
increases in protein synthesis or decrease delayed onset muscle soreness.
Caffeine is a long-standing supplement in the realm of athletic performance. Caffeine
use has been shown to improve physical and cognitive performance in several sports due
in large part to its ability to modulate central and peripheral nervous system activity [ 63 ].
Several studies support the use of caffeine among combat athletes [76–78]. A systematic
review conducted by Lopez-Gonzalez et al. [ 79 ] found that supplementation with 3–6 mg/
kg of caffeine increased the glycolytic contribution (as evidenced by increased blood
lactate concentrations) to energy metabolism during the execution of real or simulated
combat bouts. Caffeine supplementation also improved levels of strength, power, and
upper arm muscular endurance, and these effects were not associated with an increase in
the perceived exertion by the athlete [ 80 ].
A systematic review by Lopes-Silva & Franchini in 2021 [ 81 ] examined the isolated and
combined effects of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) and β-alanine (BA) supplementation
on the performance of combat sports athletes. The results showed that acute and chronic
isolated ingestion of NaHCO 3 and chronic BA are effective in improving performance in
the Wingate test, Upper Wingate test, Special Judo fitness test and Karate-specific aerobic
test, which translates to advancing combat sports athlete’s performance via muscle
functionality and localized muscle buffering capacity. Additionally, the co-ingestion of
BA and NaHCO 3 resulted in additional improvements across testing. However, the authors
found no benefit to taking these supplements individually.

```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 15

Halz et al. [ 82 ] conducted a study with 16 elite judo athletes (21.8 ± 2.5 years old) where
athletes were randomly assigned to receive either BA (4 g/d over the first 2 weeks and 6 g/
d in the last 2 weeks) or placebo for 4 weeks. Before and after BA supplementation, the
athletes completed two double 30-s upper and lower limb Wingate tests, separated by
3 min. The results showed that BA supplementation significantly improved lower and
upper limb total work and upper limb mean power during the Wingate test. However,
there were no significant differences in lower limb mean power in the BA group when
compared to the placebo group. These authors concluded that chronic BA supplementa-
tion effectively enhances high-intensity intermittent upper- and lower-body performance
in highly trained judo athletes.
Creatine monohydrate is one of the most studied supplements in human performance,
and its safety and efficacy are indisputable [ 83 , 84 ]. Studies consistently demonstrate
positive ergogenic effects on single and multiple bouts of short-duration, high-intensity
exercise activities, in addition to enhancing exercise training adaptations after creatine
supplementation. These qualities are crucial to success in MMA [85–87]. Another pro-
posed benefit of creatine, which is vital for sustaining the training volumes and intensities
associated with combat sports, is the facilitation of glycogen replenishment. Roberts et al.
[ 87 ] confirmed the ability of creatine supplementation to enhance post-exercise muscle
glycogen storage during a conventional and rigorously controlled carbohydrate-loading
regimen in humans. Additionally, creatine may also provide benefits for MMA athletes by
mitigating the effects of traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and ongoing therapeutic applica-
tions are now being examined [ 88 ]. Doses ranging from 5 to 10 g/daily are generally
recommended for enhancing performance, however research is indicating that higher
doses may be warranted for the potential neuroprotective effects.
Delleli et al. [ 89 ] conducted a systematic review on the effects of beetroot juice
(nitrates) on performance in combat athletes. While this review did not assess the effects
of combat sports skills, it showed that nitrates may improve oxidative metabolism and
force production for combat sports athletes. Effects may vary based on the population,
intake duration, muscle group activated, and exercise type.
β-hydroxy-β-methyl-butyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of leucine that is formed through α-
ketoisocaproate. Recently, Tartibian and Rezaei [68] demonstrated that HMB supplementa-
tion significantly improves physiological recovery markers, attenuates muscle damage, and
enhances recovery by modulating cortisol, IGF-1 levels, and perceived recovery status in
elite wrestlers following a simulated wrestling protocol. Durkalec-Michalski et al. [ 90 ]
demonstrated that HMB supplementation significantly improves body composition and
enhances both aerobic and anaerobic capacities in highly trained combat sports athletes
over 12 weeks without affecting blood markers [ 91 ]. In a study by Hung et al. [ 92 ], it was
found that short-term oral supplementation of three grams per day of HMB for 3 days can
reduce body fat in well-trained female judo athletes undergoing energy restriction, without
affecting lean body mass or exercise performance. In support, Chang et al. [ 93 ] found that
HMB supplementation during acute weight loss in well-trained boxers can preserve fat-free
mass and maintain heart rate response during simulated matches, without significantly
affecting glucose, fat, and protein metabolism under energy restriction. The exact mechan-
ism of action is not clear, but it is believed that HMB has an anti-catabolic effect (possibly by
sparing leucine) and promotes anabolic action [ 94 ]. These anti-catabolic effects can be
particularly beneficial during fight camp when training volumes and intensities are

16 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


increased, and caloric intake is decreased for weight-loss purposes. The literature suggests
that a dosage of 1–3 g (38–40 mg/kg) of HMB can be beneficial [ 94 , 95 ].
Essential amino acids (EAAs) can play a vital role in fostering muscle protein synthesis
in combat athletes [ 96 ]. Essential Amino Acids cannot be synthesized de novo in humans
and must be supplied by diet. Essential Amino Acids ingestion in free form in approxi-
mately ten-gram doses or as part of a protein bolus of 20–40 g after exercise are known to
stimulate muscle protein synthesis [ 97 ]. From these results, consuming EEAs could
increase strength and improve body composition by increasing lean body mass, and
preserving lean mass during the longitudinal weight descent of the combat athlete [ 98 ].
A well-balanced diet may provide sufficient micronutrients, but combat athletes who
practice rapid weight-loss or eliminate whole food groups may be at risk of nutrient
deficiencies [ 43 ]. Additionally, the high training loads of fight camps and elevated
energetic demands are believed to lead to an increase in micronutrient needs [ 48 ].
Supplementation with basic micronutrients may be warranted.
The sports nutrition professional may consider these supplements as part of the
training practices of combat athletes. Therefore, remaining abreast of the current research
will aid the sports nutrition professional in deciding which supplements have the highest
efficacy and utility for the combat sport athlete. It is vital that the sports nutrition
professional recommend supplements that have been third-party tested to meet label
claims and be free of banned substances.

#### 5.1.6. Off camp – general preparation phase – practical applications

```
●The general preparation phase is a time to improve aerobic fitness, improve skills,
and optimize physical qualities such as strength, power, speed, and mobility.
●Anecdotally, combat athletes’ maximum walk-around weight should range from
12–15% above their desired weight class.
●Determining the combat athlete’s resting metabolic rate and TDEE is imperative for
maintaining an optimal weight and pairing energy and nutrient demands to training
volumes and intensities.
●Combat athlete’s protein requirements range from 1.2–2.4 g/kg, with amounts closer
to 2 g/kg being considered a target intake.
●While 8–12 g Carbohydrates/kg body weight has been recommended for athletes
completing high volumes of endurance exercise, a range of 4-5 g Carbohydrates/kg
body weight may be an appropriate starting intake for combat sports athletes once
matched with TDEE in the general preparation phase.
●The general preparation phase is an ideal time to determine the potential supple-
ments needed to support the rigors of training and recovery.
●Supplements supported via evidence, such as caffeine, creatine, beta-alanine,
nitrates, and essential amino acids, may be used to support the training demands
and recovery for combat sport athletes. HMB may preserve lean body mass during
the longitudinal weight descent phase.
●Obtaining a detailed history/assessment of the combat athletes’ previous dietary
practices, weight cut strategies and frequency of previous weight cuts will help the
sports nutrition professional develop the most suitable nutritional practices for all
phases of the combat athletes’ training.

#### 5.2. Fight camp phase

Fight camp refers to the formalized training period leading up to a pre-determined fight
date. The average fight camp phase ranges from 8 to 10 weeks, depending on the
competition schedule. During this time, combat athletes are preparing for the demands
of an upcoming match. Training regimens are characterized by moderate to intense
exercise which usually includes strength training, technical sparring, multi-disciplinary
skill acquisition, and recovery modalities.

#### 5.2.1. Longitudinal weight descent

The types of weight-loss methods that are utilized prior to competition across all combat
sports include: fasting, low energy intake, gradual dieting, restricting fluid intake, increas-
ing sweat response such as heated wrestling, plastic suits, saunas, and heat exposure.
Other practices commonly include taking diet pills, enemas, laxatives, and engaging in
bulimia [ 99 ]. While these tactics are adopted at times, they are not endorsed by the ISSN,
and the authors of this position stand. Furthermore, self-reported data show that gradual
dieting and increased energy expenditure due to greater training frequencies are com-
mon in all combat sports. However, the weight-loss practices are not identical between
combat sports, with the most common practices shared between boxing and MMA [ 99 ].
A primary physiological objective of fight camp is to decrease body fat. Such decreases
can be advantageous for combat athletes as it may foster a greater strength-to-mass ratio,
improve the endurance needed for mastering skill applications, and lead to a more
effective longitudinal weight descent. Moreover, lean body mass holds more water
compared to adipose tissue [ 100 ]. Therefore, maintaining or increasing lean body mass
may aid in successful water manipulation and effective acute water loss strategies 24–
48 h prior to weigh-in. Some combat athletes gradually reduce weight during the general
preparation phase, which may be warranted if they are above the targeted 12–15% walk-
around weight threshold. In this regard, athletes have started their weight descent as high
as 18% above their required scale weight and successfully arrived at the weight for their
division in 8 weeks as shown in Figure 1. However, this magnitude of weight descent was
closely supervised by the nutrition professionals of the UFC Performance Institute and
may not be advised for most athletes.
An area of emerging research involves investigating the effects of specific diets on
athlete performance. The high fat diet in endurance athletes may induce metabolic
adaptations [ 101 , 102 ], but it has been debated whether these changes improve perfor-
mance [ 103 ]. In contrast, high carbohydrate diets are shown to increase short-term
performance and recovery when performing repeated high-intensity activities and recov-
ery, which is the underlying nature of combat sports [ 49 , 104 , 105 ]. Higher protein intake
during the longitudinal weight descent promotes the preservation of lean body mass
during caloric deficits [ 106 ]. Although protein is a vital macronutrient, higher protein

18 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


intake should not compromise appropriate intake of carbohydrates and/or fat intake.
Good sources of protein are lean meats such as skinless chicken, steak, eggs, fish, lentils,
beans, and isolated or concentrated protein powders [ 43 ]. Ready-to-drink protein shakes
and powders may have utility during fight camp for use between training sessions, since
combat athletes often have several sessions a day.
Combat athletes are commonly recommended to aim for weight loss of 0.5–1 kg of
body mass each week with the resulting energy deficit being based largely on total daily
energy needs [ 38 , 107 ]. This rate of decline and the concomitant magnitude of energy
deficit is contingent upon the length of the camp and how much body mass must be lost.
Accordingly, the sports nutrition professional can calculate a rate of weekly weight loss
based on the duration of the fight camp and the total loss in body mass that is required;
then plan a systematic longitudinal weight descent.
It is advisable that the sports nutrition professional carefully monitor changes in body
mass and body composition as it is common for combat athletes to lose weight too swiftly
if they are not meeting their energy requirements during fight camp. This may lead to
decrements in skill training, endurance, recovery, motivation, and losses in lean tis-
sue [ 38 ].
As discussed, the Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham equation coupled with the levels of
physical activity can be used to calculate energy needs during the longitudinal weight
descent phase of fight camp. Although undesirable, if the athlete starts fight camp >15%
above their desired weight class or if training camp is of shorter duration, such as <

weeks, a greater speed and magnitude of weight loss will be required. However, due to
the intense training demands during fight camp, carbohydrate intake should not drop
below 3–4 g/kg/d [ 86 , 98 , 108 ]. A protein intake of 1.2–2.2 g/kg/d is advised to preserve
lean tissue and aid in recovery during the energy deficit [ 54 , 106 ]. To facilitate an energy
deficit needed for a 0.5–1 kg loss of body mass per week, fat intake is often manipulated
to elicit a greater energy deficit, resulting in fat intake levels that can range from 0.7 to 1.3
g/kg/d. However, this range may need to be further adjusted to couple with TDEE. As the
combat athlete’s body mass descends, subtle adjustments in energy intake may be
warranted and most often a decline in energy is commensurate with the loss in body
mass and/or changes in RMR that occur. Moreover, this strategy must still support the
total training volume, which may include skills training and conditioning.

#### 5.2.2. Tapering

Tapering for MMA competition often involves a strategic reduction in training load while
integrating heat acclimation, sweat sessions, and nutritional manipulation to prepare for
fight week and competition. The taper period typically begins 1–2 weeks before fight
week and may involve a reduction in training volume by approximately 40%.
Incorporating high-intensity, fight-specific drills, helps maintain neuromuscular adapta-
tions at an intensity sufficient to prevent detraining effects and maintain technical acuity
[ 109 , 110 ]. Additionally, increasing heat acclimation sessions, such as using a sauna or hot
bath, can enhance sweat rates, improve heat tolerance, and aid in weight management
during tapering period [ 111 ]. These sessions, combined with additional sweat suit or
plastic-wrapped cardio sessions, may be employed to compensate for the decreased
training volume [ 37 ].
Nutritional strategies during the taper should involve a methodical decrease in calories
and hydration to align with the reduced training load and manipulating macronutrients
to prepare for fight week. A gradual reduction in carbohydrate intake can promote
glycogen depletion and assist in weight reduction due to the water loss associated with
glycogen stores [ 112 ]. Simultaneously, protein intake should be maintained to preserve
muscle mass, while fat intake can be adjusted to meet caloric goals while attempting to
maintain performance output [ 107 , 113 ]. Combining nutritional adjustments with both
rapid weight loss and acute water loss strategies allows for effective weight management
and readiness for fight week [ 37 ]. This tapering period and the strategies discussed will
enable combat athletes to optimize their preparation for fight week and maximize their
performance on fight day [ 22 , 112 ].

#### 5.2.3. Fight camp – nutrient timing

Combat athletes may engage in up to three training sessions per day during fight camp.
As mentioned previously, training sessions may be brief (i.e. 45 minutes), or can be
extended sessions (i.e. 90 to 120 min) of various intensities and metabolic demands
[ 98 ]. Thus, planning meal frequency around the athlete’s training schedule aids in meet-
ing carbohydrate and protein needs for the day. The ISSN’s Position Stand on Nutrient
Timing details such strategies, and relevant points are summarized here. It is recom-
mended athletes consume a meal two to 3 h prior to their first training session [ 97 ].
Strategies for acute fueling prior to training session (e.g. 60 minutes) include consuming
high glycemic, carbohydrates (1–4 g/kg) while limiting fat and fiber intake to minimizing

20 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


gastrointestinal distress during exercise. During high-intensity exercise, especially in hot
conditions, athletes should consume a carbohydrate solution (6–8% concentration) to
maintain blood glucose levels and hydration. Following a training session, consuming
a combination of carbohydrates (≥1.2 g/kg/h) and protein (0.2–0.5 g/kg/h) post-training
session enhances glycogen repletion and supports muscle recovery. Due to the multiple
training sessions scheduled during fight camp, rapid refueling strategies may be adopted
for sessions less than 6 h apart. The ISSN recommends a carbohydrate intake of 0.6 to
1.0 g/kg of body mass within the first 30 min after exercise, followed by carbohydrate
intake every 2 h for the next 4 to 6 h to promote maximal glycogen replenishment. As
mentioned previously, adding protein to carbohydrate intake enhances glycogen
resynthesis. During fight camp, athletes focus on performance and longitudinal weight
loss. This emphasizes the need for a well-planned diet that aligns with training sche-
dules and fight weight goals.

#### 5.2.4. Hydration

Proper hydration is imperative for the health and performance of athletes. Even a small
change of 2.5% in body weight due to dehydration can impair performance [ 114 ].
Adequate hydration should aid in supporting metabolic and training demands, reducing
the risk of injury, and promoting recovery. The primary determinant of maintenance water
requirement appears to be metabolic. However, total fluid requirements are highly
variable and quite complex. Therefore, it is challenging to set a daily water requirement
for combat athletes. Nevertheless, 1.5 ml/kcal may be suitable to cover variations in
activity level, sweating, and solute load [ 115 ].
It is recommended that combat athletes focus on consuming sodium and potassium-
based fluids to avoid electrolyte imbalances [ 98 , 116 ]. In situations where there is excessive
water loss due to individual sweat rates or hot, high humidity environments, athletes may
need to consume more water. For quick and complete rehydration, a simple approxima-
tion of 1.5 L of fluid per kg weight loss is recommended [ 111 ]. Fluid loss and intake must
be closely monitored during a fight camp to gauge sweat rates. A good strategy to
manage fluid balance is to take measurements of the athlete’s body weights preceding
and following training sessions [ 48 ]. This may aid the sports nutrition professional in
ensuring proper fluid replenishment and provides essential information regarding acute
water loss and sweat rates that can inform weight-making tactics during fight week.
During fight camp, heat acclimation activities can be beneficial for combat athletes.
The primary goal of heat acclimation is to increase the amount of sweat produced by
sweat glands, thus increasing overall whole-body sweat rate [ 117 ]. Heat acclimation is
induced by cumulative exposure to heat stress which in turn leads to physiological
adaptations including an increase in plasma volume, increased sweat rate, increased
cutaneous vasodilation and more efficient sweating over the body’s surface [ 118 ]. With
habitual activation (e.g. heat acclimation), sweat glands demonstrate plasticity in their
size and neural/hormonal sensitivity, which in turn impact sweat rates and sweat [Na+]
[ 117 ]. It is of notable importance to consider that sweat rates vary amongst individuals.
Generally, individuals who are heat acclimated will start to sweat earlier and will have
a higher sweat rate while exercising/training. Additionally, it is commonly understood
that athletes with a larger body mass and BMI will sweat more readily compared to
individuals with a smaller body mass. Nevertheless, two individuals with a comparable

```

```

body mass and similar exposure to heat acclimation may have differing sweat rates due to
genetic distinctions, surface area-to-mass ratio, aerobic capacity, exercise intensity, and
environmental conditions [ 119 ]. It should also be noted that there are seasonal adapta-
tions in sweat rates from winter to summer, and athletes consistently living and training
closer to the equatorial latitudes, particularly with high humidity, may have increased
whole-body sweat rates and water loss [ 120 ]. Hence, monitoring sweat rates during fight
camp can provide valuable insight into combat sport athletes’ daily fluid losses from
training and/or heat acclimation activities.
Because of the limited published literature on heat acclimation and sweat rates in
combat sports, the authors propose the following protocol which has been derived from
methods currently adopted by combat athletes. Heat acclimation protocols can be
planned during the fight camp and throughout longitudinal weight descent. Protocols
should begin 4–5 weeks prior to the acute water loss phase during fight week. With
respect to the proper modalities, athletes can use the sauna 3–4 times weekly for
15–25 min or hot water immersion for 20 min 2–3 times per week. Acclimation starting
points and frequency of sessions will vary based on the athlete’s weight, body composi-
tion, typical fluid turnover during training, and training environment (temperature and
humidity).

#### 5.2.5. Longitudinal weight descent - practical applications

```
●Without modalities that measure RMR, utilize the Mifflin St Jeor or Cunningham
equations to determine daily energy requirements.
●Aim for 0.5–1 kg in body mass loss per week. For more aggressive weight loss, create
a larger caloric deficit, but do not drop below the athlete’s RMR.
●Adjust caloric intake as needed during the weight descent proportionate to losses in
body mass.
●Monitor the athlete’s rate of weight descent.
●Carbohydrate intake should not drop below 3–4 g/kg/d.
●Protein intake during weight descent should be 1.6–2.2 g/kg/d.
●Fat intake can range from 0.7–1.3 g/kg/d and may need to be lowered to create an
energy deficit and drive body mass loss.
●Monitor fluid turnover rates and rehydration during training and sparring.
●Numerous factors contribute to sweat rates, such as genetics, body mass, body
surface area to mass ratio, climate, humidity, and acclimation to heat.
●If necessary, heat acclimation strategies may be used to promote increased whole
body sweat rates.

#### 5.3. Nutritional considerations the injured athlete

Combat athletes participate in sports where the primary goal is engaging in direct contact
with the opponent. Many of the combat disciplines wear minimal protective equipment
and thus injuries are inevitable. Common injuries occur to skeletal muscle, bone, tendon,
and ligament. Injuries normally occur to the head, specifically in the head, wrist/hand and
knees and shoulders. The most frequent injury types are lacerations, fractures, and
concussions [ 3 ]. Although injuries frequently occur during a competition, injuries outside
of a match are also commonplace. Overtraining and overuse injuries, stemming from the

22 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


demanding training schedules can also occur and contribute to the increased risk profiles
of combat athletes’ [ 121 , 122 ].
Though several nutrition strategies exist to address injury prevention and recovery,
a hierarchy is commonly followed. Inadequate dietary intake can increase the risk of
injury, impair performance, and contribute to an overproduction of stress hormones [ 123 ].
Consequently, the top priority that should be addressed is ensuring energy balance is
maintained as outlined in the General Preparation section. When the energy intake is
insufficient, the body will start to further break down lean mass to use as energy [ 124 ].
Though protein intake plays a crucial role in protein turnover and lean mass maintenance,
it is important to keep in mind that when energy intake is insufficient, protein may be
required to contribute to energy demands [ 124 ]. Due to protein’s role in tissue repair and
lean mass maintenance, protein requirements will therefore be even greater during injury.
Intakes as high as 2.3 g/kg/day can minimize muscle loss during energy deficits in active
individuals [ 47 , 125 ]. In critical care patients, intakes ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 g/kg/day
support recovery and healing [ 126 ]. Based on the literature, the authors recommend
1.3–2.5 g/kg/day of protein to promote healing and maintain lean body mass during
injury recovery. Distributing protein intake throughout the day may make it more man-
ageable for athletes to meet their protein intake goals. It is also critical to be aware of the
micronutrient needs during the period of injury. Micronutrients are necessary to support
tissue repair and recovery. For example, vitamin D positively affects the immune system
and combats inflammation in muscles and bones [ 48 ]. Vitamin C and zinc are important
for the immune system and are frequently used in wound healing [ 48 ]. Other dietary
supplements can also be considered for their potential effects in promoting recovery (e.g.
creatine monohydrate, fish oils, curcumin, probiotics, and amino acids [Table 3 ]).

#### 5.3.1. Nutrition for traumatic brain injury

As with other impact sports, the prevalence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in combat
sports is high, particularly during fight camp when sparring and live drills are often
emphasized. The causes of TBI in combat sports vary from direct impact or hits to the
head, knockouts, or takedowns involving blunt force to the head [ 127 ]. TBIs range in
severity and are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Many fighters have experienced
some form of TBI during their careers [ 127 , 128 ]. Thus, nutrition strategies implemented
following TBI may aid in their recovery and timely return to sport [ 129 , 130 ].
Following a TBI, nutritional considerations are aimed at supporting repair and
recovery, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, neurogenesis, and restoring
function [ 131 ]. As with general injury nutritional management, adequate protein
and energy are paramount. Research suggests that increasing protein and energy
intake in the hours following a TBI improves neurological outcomes and lowers
mortality rates [ 132 , 133 ]. During TBI recovery, energy needs are estimated to
increase between 100% and 200% of baseline resting energy expenditure values
[ 134 ]. Equations to predict resting energy expenditure (Mifflin St-Jeor of
Cunningham) or indirect calorimeters should be used to estimate baseline resting
energy expenditure. Protein intake of approximately 2 g/kg/d total protein further
supports recovery from TBI [ 135 ]. Supplementation can also aid the recovery
process as well as help combat athletes consume the therapeutic doses of essen-
tial nutrients. Research suggests that creatine may have neuroprotective effects

[ 136 ] by minimizing inflammation and preserving brain tissue [ 136 ]. Studies in
adolescents reported improvements in cognitive function and reduced headaches,
dizziness, and fatigue with creatine supplementation following mild TBI [ 137 ].
Other supplements including omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidant supplements, and
B-vitamins also support brain function and are shown to reduce the severity of
brain injuries [ 129 , 130 ]. Omega-3 fatty acids, commonly found in fish oil supple-
ments, have anti-inflammatory properties, and may help reduce neuroinflammation
[ 131 ]. Antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, B vitamins and vitamin E are
thought to mitigate oxidative damage following TBI [ 138 ]. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is
a precursor to glutathione, and glutathione offers neuroprotective effects from
oxidative damage stemming from brain injuries [ 139 ]. Although such clinical nutri-
tional therapies do not cure TBIs, there is compelling evidence supporting nutrition
being beneficial in promoting recovery from brain injuries. Furthermore, inade-
quate nutritional intake impairs the recovery process.

#### 5.4 Fight week/rapid weight-loss strategies

Weight cutting is a process that includes weight loss (RWL) to qualify for a desired weight
class division, followed by rapid weight gain (RWG) to recover body mass losses before the

start of the competition [ 36 ]. When official weigh-in occurs on the day before in MMA,
approximately 24–36 h remain prior to the beginning of competition. This duration is
thought to be an adequate amount of time for athletes to rehydrate and refuel sufficiently
and safely [ 140 ].
Weight can be lost rapidly through, water loading, fluid restriction, acute dehydration,
hot water immersion/salt baths and sauna, fasting, and reduced carbohydrate and fiber
intakes [ 141 , 142 ]. Barley et al. provided insights into the weight cutting strategies across
combat sports disciplines. Six hundred thirty-seven athletes from judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,
boxing, MMA, and Muay Thai/kickboxing were surveyed online. Results showed that 87%
of combat athletes included food restriction (skipping meals, reducing overall energy
intake to <22 kcal/kg), 83% used water loading (hyperhydration), 79% restricted fluids
(hypohydration), 51% used sauna, 85% increased training, and 43% used sweat suits and
plastics [ 138 , 143 ]. Additionally, some combat athletes may use potentially harmful meth-
ods, such as diuretics and laxatives to lose excessive body weight as they aim to compete
in the lowest possible weight class [ 99 ]. Such practices have a detrimental effect on
health, well-being, mood, and performance [ 107 , 144 ].
There have been studies that have reported weight cutting practices to have no
negative effect on exercise performance [ 37 , 145 ]. However, there remains a limited
body of scientific research investigating rapid weight-loss strategies, which includes
evaluations of the different methods, the influence on competitive performance, acute
physiological changes, and refueling and recovery methods to improve performance
following rapid weight loss [ 99 ]. The existing literature on the current practices for several
rapid weight-loss strategies is discussed in this section.

#### 5.4.1. Glycogen depletion

Dietary carbohydrates are stored in skeletal muscle (350–700 g) and liver tissue (80–100 g)
as glycogen and act as readily available energy reserves for glucose metabolism with final
concentrations being dependent upon training status, diet, muscle fiber-type composi-
tion, sex, and body mass [ 146 ]. Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose that binds to
water at a ratio of 1 g glycogen to 2.7 g water [ 147 ]. Glycogen can contribute as much as
1–2% of skeletal muscle mass and up to 8% of liver mass [ 112 , 148 ]. In consideration of
this, previous research has shown that 7 days of a low carbohydrate diet, combined with
training and a slight reduction in energy intake (<10%), can achieve a body mass reduc-
tion of 2% while maintaining strength/power measured via a 30-s Wingate test [ 149 ].
A similar body mass loss was achieved following a 14-day period of carbohydrate restric-
tion. Thus, due to the known association of water content with endogenous glycogen
content, glycogen depletion continues to be a common means for combat athletes to
reduce body mass.
A low carbohydrate diet can aid in glycogen depletion. Although combat athletes
need carbohydrates for performance, adhering to <50 g carbohydrates/day during the
rapid weight-loss phase prevents glycogen replenishment. The need for carbohydrates
to drive high-intensity work, and its connection to body mass via glycogen status
create an ongoing conflict for the combat athlete. The extent to which glycogen levels
can be manipulated is primarily influenced by carbohydrate intake and the existing
glycogen status before implementing glycogen-depleting strategies [ 150 ]. The rate/
amount of glycogen depletion is in part predicated on the athlete’s typical

```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 25
```

carbohydrate intake, which should be calculated in grams and calories. In addition, the
degree to which one can/should manipulate glycogen status is limited by the recovery
window (i.e. time from official weigh-in to competition) of different combat sport
disciplines and the regulations of the promotion. Care should be taken to evaluate
the cost/benefit of additional exercise in the period just prior to weigh-ins versus
a longer period of carbohydrate restriction prior to competition [ 151 ]. Ultimately,
exercise intensity, duration, and carbohydrate feeding will dictate the rate of glycogen
depletion. During fight week, training sessions typically include technique work, drills,
and additional aerobic exercise, often under the auspices of the skill coach. Many skills
coaches have combat athletes continue technique work and drills during fight week,
which may result in greater skeletal muscle glycogen depletion due to the high-
intensity nature of the activity. If the athlete is restricting dietary carbohydrates and
continues high-intensity skills training, glycogen stores can be significantly depleted
within hours.
Therefore, training intensity and frequencies, carbohydrate intake, and body weight
should be carefully monitored to ensure an effective weight cut. Accordingly, because
total calories, carbohydrates, and water may be restricted, if additional activity is needed
for glycogen depletion and rapid weight loss, low-intensity steady state (LISS) cardio may
have utility during fight week [ 151 ]. To achieve this, an exercise intensity ranging between
40% and 50% of maximum heart rate for 30–45 min should be suitable as an additional
method for rapid weight loss. Consequently, the sports nutrition professional must work
in concert with the fight week strategies of the skills coach and monitor training frequen-
cies and intensity, exercise protocols, and losses in body mass, to perform glycogen
depletion safely and effectively.

#### 5.4.1.1. Glycogen depletion practical – applications.

```
●Before glycogen depletion is initiated, the sports nutrition professional should
calculate the combat sport athlete’s average daily carbohydrate intake.
●Glycogen depletion can begin as early as seven days prior to weigh-in. For most
combat athletes, a minimum of 72 h is sufficient.
●Following a low carbohydrate diet (2–3 g/kg/d) may be required to prevent the
restoration of muscle glycogen stores following their depletion via skills training
and/or additional cardiovascular activity.
●Plan carbohydrate intake and glycogen depletion in accordance with fight week
training intensities and volumes.
●Glycogen depletion can result in a loss of 1–2% of body mass.
●The total amount of carbohydrate restriction during fight week will also be subject to
how much body mass must be lost for the combat athlete to achieve their desired
weight.
●Carbohydrate restriction as a practice should be limited when possible and imple-
mented only as needed for rapid weight loss.
```
#### 5.4.2. Fiber manipulation

The use of bowel preparation formulas, such as those used in clinical situations to
prepare the gastrointestinal tract for surgery (i.e. laxatives), is not uncommon among
weight class athletes. Indeed, such tactics can be used to facilitate the removal of

26 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


intestinal contents and promote acute water loss [ 152 ]. While these methods may be
effective for expelling the colon of intestinal bulk, the use of clinical bowel preparation
formulas (e.g. osmotic laxatives and purgatives) has been shown to reduce exercise
capacity and ultimately overall performance and therefore it is not recommended
[ 153 ]. Instead, dietary strategies to reduce total food volume may therefore be
a preferable way to manipulate the mass of intestinal contents while maintaining
performance [ 152 ].
Dietary fiber can slow the transit time of food through the bowel and draw water into the
intestinal space, thereby adding bulk to stools [ 152 ]. Different foods possess different fecal
bulking properties [ 154 ], and ultimately the changes in habitual fiber intake, particularly
non-fermentable fibers, can elicit changes in body mass. Estimated fermentability has been
shown to determine the role of fiber in total fecal wet weight. Less fermentable dietary
fibers from cereals, such as wheat bran, contribute the most to total fecal weight compared
to more fermentable dietary fibers, such as those originating from fruits [ 154 ]. This addi-
tional fecal matter is likely due to non-fermentable fiber’s higher water-binding capacity, as
well as its greater resistance to fermentation from colonic bacteria. There appears to be
a linear relationship between fiber intake and bowel cleanliness in pre-colonoscopy patients
[ 155 ], and the utilization of a low-fiber diet for 2 days prior to treatment reduced bowel
cleanliness compared to high-fiber diets [ 155 ]. Indeed, when a low-fiber diet (<10 g/d) was
continued for 7 days, it was as effective as a bowel preparation formula [ 156 ]. In a study of
19 healthy males consuming a habitual high-fiber diet of 30 g fiber/day for 7 days followed
by four of a low-fiber diet (<10 g fiber/d) that was matched for energy and macronutrients,
a significant reduction in body mass was shown after 4 days of a low-fiber diet (Δ = 0.4 ±
0.91% p < 0.05) and on day 5 (Δ = 0.74 ± 0.99% p < 0.01). Subjects did report increased
hunger and a decline in stool frequency; however, the diet modification was reported to
be tolerated and repeatable [ 157 ].
Despite limited research on the bowel-emptying effects of a low-fiber diet, the use of
low fiber diet appears to be a useful tool for reducing body mass without the need for
bowel preparation formulas, which can ultimately pose a risk of undue physiological
stress on the gastrointestinal system [ 156 ]. Additionally, following a low-fiber diet for
a minimum of 3 days seems to be effective for rapid weight loss with minimal disruption,
despite moderate increases in appetite, reductions in bowel movements, and hardening
of stools. Considerations should be made to identify habitual dietary fiber intake and fiber
type to better estimate and proactively account for changes in body mass when following
a low-fiber diet. Furthermore, since females and older populations have reported slower
GI motility, further research needs to be conducted to understand the interplay between
gender and age in the effects of low fiber on body mass changes [ 158 ]. Further research is
needed to establish precise guidelines for the use of low-fiber diet due to the large
variations in whole gut transit times, which can range from 10 to 96 h [ 159 ]. Continued
research on the implications of low-fiber diets in weight-making sports, as well as health
and performance outcomes, is warranted.

#### 5.4.2.1 Fiber manipulation practical – applications.

```
●Low-fiber diet may be used as a tool to aid RWL in weight class sports.
●Reducing dietary fiber from habitual intake (>30 g/d) to a Low fiber diet (<10 g/d) for

●Non-fermentable fibers from cereals, wheat bran, and vegetables contribute to fecal

#### 5.4.3. Sodium manipulation

As combat athletes lose water and electrolytes through thermoregulatory sweating
during heat exposure, aerobic activity, and skills training during fight week, it is well
established that the rate and composition of sweat can vary significantly within and
between individuals [ 160 ]. Scientists and practitioners may conduct sweat tests to deter-
mine sweat and electrolyte losses, particularly sodium. However, the current methodolo-
gical practices and challenging field conditions often lead to inconsistent and inaccurate
results. While techniques like whole body washdown, which is the reference standard,
require a laboratory, more practical methods such as sweat patches have shown incon-
sistency and limited effectiveness [ 160 ].
Accordingly, determining how much sodium to ingest or restrict during fight week
proposes numerous challenges. To establish a measure of sodium restriction, it is advi-
sable that the sports nutrition professional first ascertain a baseline of sodium intake
during fight camp and then propose a lower sodium intake of < 2.3 g daily during fight
week, if needed. Due to increases in sweat loss, athletes should not consume less than the
current RDA of 2300 mg/day in order to minimize sodium losses [ 161 , 162 ]. Thus, for
athletes whose base intake is below 2300 mg, more emphasis can be put on other
water manipulation modalities. Physiologically, the human body tightly regulates the
osmotic pressure of body fluids through renal excretion and retention of electrolytes and
fluids. A summary of literature examining the relationship between sodium intake and
water intake found that in a steady state, urine volume remains unchanged over a broad
range of sodium intakes. Rather, the adaptation to higher sodium excretion lies only in
changes in urinary sodium concentration [ 163 ].
Water retention is responsible for the well-documented increase in body mass follow-
ing acute increases in sodium intake [ 163 ]. The resulting increase in fluid intake due to
thirst in conjunction with no significant changes in urine volume causes the extra fluid to
remain in the body to limit the rise in plasma sodium concentration by diluting the
sodium that cannot be excreted quicky enough [ 163 ]. In a steady state, if sodium levels
remain within a reasonable range of (50–250 mmol/day), most of the observed adaptation
will rest on changes in the concentration of sodium in the urine without any changes in
urine flow rate. However, when an abrupt change in sodium occurs (e.g. 70 mmol/d to
250 mmol/d), assuming usual daily activities remain constant and without any limitations
in water intake, a return to sodium and body mass balance requires 2–3 days [ 164 ].
The complexity of sodium steady state dynamics and its relationship to body mass
changes is further complicated by the varying tactics utilized by combat athletes such as
hyperhydration (water loading), heat acclimation, caloric restriction, diuretics, etc., during
the weight-cutting period [ 116 , 143 , 165 , 166 ]. Despite the limited body of research on
varying sodium levels and their effects on acute water loss, sodium restriction has become
a common practice among some combat athletes during the weight cutting period [ 98 ].
Due to the limitations in previous research aimed at investigating the role of sodium

28 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


restriction on acute water loss in combat athletes, the precise degree to which sodium
needs to be reduced is unknown. Further research is warranted.

#### 5.4.3.1 Sodium restriction – practical applications.

```
●Sodium restriction should be based on athlete’s usual intake and anticipated/needed
water loss.
●Sodium restriction recommendations may vary greatly, and there is a paucity of
research associated with restriction and acute water loss. A low sodium diet of < 2.3
grams of sodium during fight week may be suitable.
●Less than 2.3 grams of sodium per day is deemed low for the general population,
individuals with significantly lower rates of sweat loss and sodium loss than combat
athletes, hence caution should be taken in dropping levels significantly below 2.3
grams.
●Monitoring both weight and fluid loss in relation to sodium restriction will determine
if sodium restriction is suitable or if additional restrictions are needed.
```
#### 5.4.4. Polyuria/water manipulation

Urine excretion is tightly regulated by the renal system. Fluid balance is achieved by
aldosterone and anti-diuretic hormone triggering a renal response to either release or
conserve fluid thereby maintaining total body water as well as electrolyte balance [ 167 ].
Urine excretion is the body’s primary fluid balance regulator and as such, typical urine
losses range from 1–2 liters per day [ 168 , 169 ]. Urine volume decreases with dehydration,
with the obligatory rate of urine production to excrete metabolic waste being 0.5 liters
per day [ 167 , 170 ]. The upper limit for urine production is 1.8 liters per day; therefore, fluid
intake that exceeds urine production limits may lead to hyponatremia [ 171 ].
To encourage polyuria and thus acute water loss, the use of pharmacological diuretics
to promote greater urine loss has been reported among combat athletes [ 166 ]. In a survey
of 637 combat athletes, the prevalence of reported diuretic use was 12% overall, with the
lowest reported use in judo of 5% and highest of 12% in Tae Kwando [ 143 ]. The survey did
not specify the type of diuretic used which may include pharmaceutical grade diuretics
and/or over-the-counter products such as caffeine anhydrous. The lower prevalence of
diuretic use may in part be due to the increase in testing and regulatory bodies that
monitor athletes given that pharmacological diuretics are included in the World Anti-
Doping Agency’s List of Prohibited Substances [ 172 ].
A commonly adopted method for inducing polyuria amongst combat athletes is water
loading or hyperhydration. Previously, water-loading practices in combat sports had been
largely based on anecdotal evidence. Athletes and sports nutrition professionals pre-
scribed varied recommendations for total fluid consumption and the durations in which
water loading should be applied. To date, there is not a robust body of research on the
subject. Water loading is a strategy characterized by the consumption of large volumes of
fluids for several days prior to fluid restriction. A rapid weight-loss questionnaire of
314 mmA athletes showed that the frequency of water loading occurred “always” or
“sometimes” in 72.9% of the athletes surveyed [ 173 ]. Barley et al. examined acute water
loss habits in 637 combat athletes and revealed a water-loading prevalence of over 60% in
MMA, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing, with an overall prevalence of 53% among all
combat sports [ 143 ].

A study which provided significant insight on the efficacy and safety of water loading
was conducted by Reid et al. [ 109 ]. They investigated the effect of water loading for 3 days
(100 ml/kg/d) compared to a control group (40 ml/kg/d), followed by fluid restriction
on day 4 (15 ml/kg/d). Significant body mass loss was observed in the water-loading
group on day 5, with a loss of 3.2% compared to 2.4% in the control (CON) group [ 116 ].
The difference in body mass loss in the water-loading group was attributed to greater
fluid loss relative to fluid intake during the period of fluid restriction, compared to the
control group. Despite concerns regarding hyponatremia, the study showed no evidence
of problematic blood chemistry changes or impaired physical performance following
rehydration. Moreover, a 3.2% loss in body mass represents nearly half of the 6.7%
above scale weight at 72 h prior to weigh-ins.
Another study conducted by Cho & Han [ 174 ] included 13 university wrestlers (weight
71.5 ± 8.0 kg, BMI 25.0 ± 2.0 kg/m^2 ) randomly divided into the weight loss (WL) group (n =
6) and water-loading weight loss (WWL) group (n = 7). Wrestlers performed a two-week
weight-loss program, targeting an average of 5–10% of body weight reduction, under the
supervision of a coach. Participants were instructed to drink 1.5–2 liters and 6–7 liters in
the weight loss and water loading weight loss groups, respectively, for two weeks prior to
weigh-in. Neither group consumed water the day before weigh-ins. Anthropometric
characteristics, hematocrit (HCT), serum electrolytes, aldosterone, and cortisol were mea-
sured before and after weight loss. Results showed the weight-loss and water-loading
weight-loss groups showed a decrease in body mass of 8.2% and 11%, respectively. These
numbers supersede the 2.4% and 3.2% loss in body mass observed by Reid et al. [ 109 ].
However, it must be considered that the wrestlers underwent approximately eleven
additional days of water loading, caloric deficits, and intense training. Hence, the total
loss in body mass of 8.2% and 11% also includes changes in body composition. Of notable
importance, there were no negative implications on blood chemistry and the researchers
concluded that large-volume hydration before water restriction for short-term loss in
body mass can be completed safely under the parameters with which this study was
conducted.

#### 5.4.5. Acute water loss

The manipulation of body mass via sweating is the most common method of rapid weight
loss undertaken by combat athletes [ 152 ]. Although sweat losses are commonly used,
there are currently no generalized standards to determine the ideal method, the optimal
duration of exposure, and the most suitable environmental factors. However, acute water
loss strategies must be applied while minimizing overheating and adverse performance
and health outcomes.
Despite previous research suggesting that combat athletes lose nearly 10% of their
total body mass pre-weigh-in [ 107 , 141 , 165 , 166 , 175 , 176 ], solely utilizing sweat loss to
achieve a 10% decline in body mass within 24 h of weigh-in is ill-advised and potentially
dangerous to health. With several factors notwithstanding, body mass losses ranging from
5% to 8% can have varying degrees of impact on health and performance. Some data
indicate that certain athletes can achieve this decline in body mass via acute water loss
and not compromise performance and health [ 166 ]. Nevertheless, to date, this remains
inconclusive.

30 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


A major challenge is understanding which acute water loss methods should be
utilized to achieve the decrease in body mass leading to weigh-ins; and what is the
true starting point to initiate acute water loss tactics. The starting point prior to acute
water loss should represent body mass in a euhydrated and well-nourished state (i.e.
prior to glycogen and fiber depletion) to take advantage of non-essential compartments
of bound water.
In a research study that captured weight loss data in 600+ successful UFC
athletes’ weight cuts, it was shown that there was a significant reduction in non-
essential body mass in the 24–72 h window prior to weigh-ins. UFC fighters were
approximately 6.7% above their weight class 72 h before weigh-ins, but were only
4.4% over their weight classes 24 h prior to weigh-ins [ 177 ]. Although the hydra-
tion status in the 24-h window before weigh-ins was not published, a 4.4% body
mass loss represents a much smaller and therefore feasible amount of acute water
loss.
It has been noted that when women and men were matched for surface area-to-
mass ratio and fitness level, both had similar heart rate and core temperature
responses to heat acclimation. Despite this, sweating responses were greater in
men, and they required a shorter heat acclimation period (4–5 days) compared to
women [ 118 ]. With the growing number of female participants in combat sports, it is
important to consider key differences in sweat rate and heat tolerance. Female
thermoregulatory responses vary throughout the menstrual cycle due to the influ-
ences of reproductive hormones estradiol and progesterone. During the luteal phase
or high hormone phase of oral contraceptive use, thermoregulatory control of both
sweating and cutaneous vasodilation is shifted by approximately 0.5 Celsius to
higher core body temperatures [ 118 ]. In hot and dry conditions, males experience
a smaller change in core temperature compared to women, whereas the opposite is
true in hot and humid climates. Men have a higher overall sweating capacity, which
allows them to respond more efficiently to dry heat [ 118 ]. It is worth noting that
women have a lower sweat capacity than men for a given amount of metabolic heat
generation, and they are also less responsive to the effects of training adaptation on
sweat rate and sweat temperature threshold [ 118 ]. Women between 18 and 35 years
of age are also five times more likely to experience symptoms associated with
orthostatic intolerance compared to men of the same age and health status [ 118 ].
Despite these differences in sweat rate and adaptations, the role of sex hormones in
thermoregulation and acute water loss (adaptive whole-body heat loss) is complex,
and further research is needed.
The prevalence of sweat loss strategies for acute water loss is not surprising consider-
ing the relatively large body mass losses that can be achieved in a rapid and time-efficient
manner, with sweat rates up to two liters per hour having been recorded [ 168 ]. The onset
of sweating can be altered by changes in plasma electrolyte concentration, plasma
volume, and total body water content. However, these factors are not optimized to
enhance sweat losses without the introduction of more fluid into the body, which is
contrary to the end goal of acute water loss [ 152 ].
Variables that may dictate the rates and volume of acute water loss includes:

```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 31
```

```
●Environment: increased ambient heat increases core temperature and increases the
need for sweat to be produced to dissipate heat [ 178 ]
●The athlete’s heat acclimation preparation
●Clothing: insulating clothing traps heat thereby increasing core temperature and
sweat rate and dark colors can increase the amount of radiant heat an athlete is
exposed [ 178 ].
●Duration and intensity of physical activity: higher exercise intensity (higher percen-
tage of VO 2 Max) requires increased energy and therefore respiration which in turn
generates more heat. The increased heat production leads to an increased sweat rate
to compensate and cool the body [ 178 ].
●Individual physiology: body’s surface area, heat acclimation and genetic/sex differ-
ences can cause variations in sweat rate [ 178 ]
●The athlete’s acute water loss strategy preferences and psychological state
```
Generally, acute water loss strategies can be classified into two categories: active
sweating (exercise or skill training often with the aid of a sauna suit or layered clothing
for insulation) or passive sweating (exposure to hot environment, e.g. sauna, steam
rooms, infra-red saunas, wraps and/or hot baths). It is important to note the differ-
ences in physiological response to active versus passive sweating. Cutaneous vasodila-
tion and sweating during heat stress results in a redistribution of blood flow to the
periphery and a requirement for increased cardiac output to meet the thermoregula-
tory demand. Passive sweating prior to active sweating decreases plasma volume,
sweat rate, and body heat storage [ 179 ]. These physiological changes occur to a lesser
extent when hypohydration develops only during exercise [ 179 ]. When combat ath-
letes are in a very depleted and hypo-hydrated state, they may need to limit active
sweat loss methods. During exercise, the mismatch between venous return and limited
cardiac output is mitigated by the muscle pump which propels blood back to the
heart. The lack of muscle pump or sudden cessation of exercise in addition to
increased peripheral venous compliance can result in a transient decrease in cerebral
perfusion pressure causing orthostatic intolerance, dizziness, fatigue, and syn-
cope [ 118 ].
Traditionally, many combat athletes make use of combining training sessions (active)
with fluid restriction to promote dehydration. Active sessions are often used with addi-
tional passive methods for acute water loss. Tangible arguments for, and against, active
strategies can be made. Active strategies such as high-intensity skills training, shadow
boxing and striking pads require increased energy expenditure and oxygen demand
which in turn generates more heat, leading to an increase in sweat rate to compensate
and cool the body. This can result in the athlete accumulating considerable acute water
losses. Additionally, many skills coaches practice active methods, such as striking and
technical sparring, with the notion that this maintains the motor skill applications which
were advanced during the general preparation and fight camp periods. Moreover, the
increased loss of peripheral skeletal muscle glycogen associated with active methods such
as hitting pads and striking, may further contribute to water loss. If the combat athlete has
greater than the average of 4.4% body mass to lose within 24 h of the official weigh-in,
both active and passive strategies may be warranted in some situations. Nonetheless, as
discussed, reduced plasma volumes from acute water loss can alter changes in cardiac

32 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


output, flow, distribution, and blood pressure, which in turn can impair the efficiency and
safety of active methods such as skills training and technical sparring [ 118 ].
It is of notable importance that many coaches, fighters and teams have established
methods for acute water loss and the sports nutrition professional may have to operate
within the preferred parameters of these strategies. As an example, if the team uses active
methods and several skill application sessions as part of acute water loss methods, then
passive strategies should be used only when required and when ample time is available
for recovery. As with all nutritional strategies in combat sports, particularly as it pertains to
acute water loss requirements, the sports nutrition professional is often required to
evaluate what is optimal and what is necessary.
Passive strategies may allow the combat athlete to spare muscle glycogen and reduce
the elevated physiological demands which active strategies may induce on both the
nervous systems and skeletal muscles. The frequency and duration of passive strategies
will be contingent on how much body mass must be reduced within 24 h of weigh-in.
Passive strategies, as with all acute water loss methods, may be appropriate when
sufficient post-weigh-in recovery time is available. Nevertheless, passive strategies must
be strategically applied to optimize the volume and rate of acute water loss [ 166 ]. It is also
prudent that the sports nutrition professional ensures that combat athletes do not over-
heat from passive strategies for acute water loss. Monitoring the athletes core tempera-
ture is a method to avoid overheating, heat stress injuries or potential hyperthermia. The
core temperature in which such conditions may occur is not exact and highly variable
between individuals. However, hyperthermia is defined as a body temperature greater
than 40° Celsius (104° Fahrenheit) [ 180 ]. Therefore, independent of the cumulative
exposure to heat acclimation the combat athlete has undertaken, it is imperative to
avoid heating near this core temperature. As with all acute water loss strategies, the
pros and cons are contingent upon any contraindications, the coexisting practices, and
the demands of the combat athlete.

#### 5.4.6. Passive weight cut strategies

In general, passive weight cut strategies refer to those modalities in which combat
athletes undergo exposure to heat for acute water loss. These strategies are most often
done without extensive physical activity.

#### 5.4.6.1. Hot baths. Hot water immersion is a common, passive method, used by

combat athletes to induce acute water loss. A survey of rapid weight-loss practices
by MMA athletes indicated that 76% of fighters report using hot baths either “always”
or “sometimes” [ 141 ]. Hot water immersion has also been coupled with the addition of
various salts, often Epsom salts, to further enhance acute water loss. Connor and Egan
[ 181 ] investigated the magnitude of body mass losses during hot water immersion
with or without the addition of salt, with the temperature commencing at 37.8°C and
being self-adjusted by participants to their maximum tolerable temperature. In
a crossover design, eight male MMA athletes (29.4 ± 5.3 y; 1.83 ± 0.05 m; 85.0 ± 4.9
kg) performed a 20-min whole-body immersion (39.0–39.5°C) followed by a 40-min full
body wrap in a warm room (24.0–29.0°C), twice in sequence per visit. The full body
wrap included a knitted wool hat, cotton t-shirt, hooded cotton sweatshirt, cotton

tracksuit bottoms/sweatpants, and socks. Participants were then covered in blankets
on a bed in an adjacent bedroom with only their faces exposed.
Additionally, the athletes restricted carbohydrates, fiber, and fluids as commonly
practiced during fight week. Body mass losses induced by just the hot bath protocols
were 1.71 ± 0.70 kg and 1.66 ± 0.78 kg, for the freshwater bath and saltwater bath, respec-
tively. Hence, demonstrating no further loss from saltwater baths [ 181 ]. The total loss in
body mass from hot water immersion was equivalent to 2.0% of body mass. Additional
losses were shown from 40-min wraps in a warm room. The combined protocols of hot
water immersion and full-body wraps produced a 4.5 ± 0.7% decrease in body mass. In
conclusion, hot water immersion can be an effective passive technique for acute water
loss with added salt, creating no further losses of body mass.

#### 5.4.6.2. Hot water immersion – practical applications.

```
●Hot water immersion is an effective method that can be applied within 24 h of
weigh-making activities (i.e. weigh-ins) with its effectiveness being contingent
upon the loss in body mass required and whether other rapid weight loss and
acute water loss modalities are being applied.
●Water temperature typically ranges from 39–40°C (102–104°F) or potentially higher if
tolerated by the athlete for durations ranging from 15–20 minutes.
●Ambient room temperature, air current and humidity levels are often controlled.
●Though Epsom salt is sometimes added to baths, recent studies have shown no
increase in loss of body mass from their addition.
●Carefully monitor the athlete’s core temperature during hot water immersion to
prevent hyperthermia (~40°C, ~104°F).
```
#### 5.4.6.3.Dry saunas. There is a paucity of data which has directly investigated the effects

of dry sauna exposure on rapid weight loss in combat athletes. Brito et al. surveyed 580
combat athletes participating in grappling (judo, jujitsu) and striking (karate and Tae
kwon do) combat sports in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. They found 50% of athletes
use saunas as a method of rapid weight loss [ 182 ]. Challenges remain with studies that
have attempted to quantify either absolute water loss and/or water loss expressed as
a percentage of initial body weight, in both women and men.
Numerous factors can play a role in the amount of water loss due to sauna exposure
such as body mass, body surface area, body composition, biological sex, hydration status,
physical activity level, frequency of sauna use, acute hormonal influence (e.g. vasopressin,
aldosterone, etc.) ambient temperature and humidity of the sauna, and the length of time
in the sauna. Additionally, some research measures water loss due to saunas using
a traditional scale, while other research uses bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).
These differences in methodology may make comparisons between different studies
difficult to interpret. Podstawski et al. [ 183 ], examined the effect of dry sauna on acute
weight loss in men using calibrated body mass scales. The participants were repeatedly
exposed to short sauna baths [4 × 10 min; 5-min breaks between sauna sessions;
temperature of ~ 90°C (~194°F) at 14–16% relative humidity] [ 183 ]. This specific sauna
protocol led to a significant loss of 0.65 kg of body mass through sweat loss [ 183 ].
Another study measured acute water loss in 674 young men and women (19–20 y)
exposed to two different 10-min dry sauna sessions [~90°C (~194°F) at 35% relative

34 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


humidity, separated by 5 min (which included 30 s of cooling in 10°C water)]. The
investigators reported decreases in body mass measures via a calibrated scale between
0.25 and 0.7 kg and 0.32–0.82 kg in women and men, respectively [ 184 ]. Interestingly, as
a percentage of overall body mass lost via sweating, both females and males lost
between ~0.5–0.9% of their initial body mass [ 184 ]. It should be noted that the more
overweight or obese the participants were, the greater amount of water loss was
observed [ 184 ]. Conversely, the least amount of water loss was recorded in the under-
weight subjects in both sexes [ 184 ]. Similar water losses when expressed as a percent of
body mass lost (~0.9%), following a sauna bath, have also been reported in earlier
research [ 185 ].

#### 5.4.6.4.Dry sauna – practical applications.

```
●Dry saunas utilize a heating element to heat ambient air which in turn raises body
temperature via conduction and convection of heated air in addition to radiation
from the heated surfaces in the sauna room.
●Dry sauna temperatures can range from 60–90 °C (140–192°F).
●Due to the significantly higher ambient temperature, care must be taken to minimize
the chances of overheating while utilizing the sauna. Cooling strategies such as icing
of the head, neck and palms can be implemented.
●Duration of dry sauna heat exposure is highly individualized with exposures lasting
from as little as 5 minutes to as long as 20 minutes.
●Research shows average fluid losses of 0.27–0.68 kg and 0.32–0.82 kg in women and
men, respectively, which is equivalent to 0.5–0.9% loss in body mass.
●Numerous factors will affect sweat rates during fight week, including body mass,
body surface area, body composition, biological sex, hydration status, physical
activity level, frequency of sauna use, acute hormonal influence (e.g. vasopressin,
aldosterone, etc.) ambient temperature and humidity of the sauna, and the length of
time in the sauna.
●Sports nutrition professionals must be prudent when deciding if dry sauna should be
part of an acute water loss protocol and the duration and temperature of exposure
which is needed.
●Carefully monitor the athletes core temperature during any type of sauna use to
prevent hyperthermia 40°C and 104°F.
```
#### 5.4.6.5.Steam rooms. Research identifying precise rates of acute sweat loss that can be

achieved through exposure to wet saunas or steam rooms is also scant. Pilch et al.

(^186) investigated the differences in acute weight loss and subjective feelings of thermal
comfort between wet sauna (~59°C/138°F and 60.5% humidity) and a dry sauna (~91°C/
196°F and 18% humidity) in young (22-24y) females. The sauna protocol (for both wet and
dry sauna) consisted of three separate 15-min intervals separated by 5-min rest/cooling
intervals. Overall, the average weight loss was significantly greater in the dry sauna (~0.37
kg) compared to the wet sauna (~0.25 kg). Additionally, rectal temperature, heart rate,
and subjective feelings of thermal discomfort were greater in the wet sauna [ 186 ]. The
same pattern of acute weight loss (dry sauna vs. wet sauna was 0.72 kg and 0.36 kg,
respectively) were also shown in men subjected to the same basic study design (three
separate 15-min intervals separated by 5-min rest/cooling intervals) using calibrated
scales [ 187 ]. The research suggests that dry sauna may be a more effective and
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 35


comfortable protocol for combat athletes during acute water loss sessions [ 186 ]. Some of
the reasons include:

```
●Steam rooms utilize steam from evaporating water to heat ambient air.
●Steam rooms can have humidity levels at 95–100% and typically have lower ambient
temperatures (50 °C, 122 °F)
●To prevent scalding, steam rooms often operate for short intervals making the man-
agement of ambient temperature and humidity challenging during acute water loss.
●Tracking sweat rate can also be challenging due to the high humidity and condensa-
tion of water on the skin’s surface. When sweating does occur, due to the high
humidity level the body’s natural evaporative cooling mechanisms are rendered
ineffective, increasing the risk of overheating.
●Dry sauna in the limited literature demonstrates higher sweat rates than steam and
may be a more effective and comfortable option.
●Due to these challenges, steam rooms should be avoided, if possible, for acute water
loss in favor of more controllable modalities.
●Carefully monitor the athletes core temperature during any type of steam room use
to prevent hyperthermia 40°C and 104°F.
```
#### 5.4.6.6.Infrared saunas/portable saunas/sauna blankets. As with the dry sauna and

steam room methods, there is limited study on the efficacy of infrared saunas.
Conventional saunas use heating elements to raise air temperatures within the units.
Infrared saunas use infrared light to heat your body while the air temperature remains
relatively unchanged. Accordingly, a combat athlete’s core temperature can rise without
having to sit in a room with ambient temperatures close to 200°F. Logically, this may be
a viable option for combat sport athletes. Infrared saunas, portable saunas, and sauna
blankets utilize infrared radiation to heat the body’s surface.

```
●Temperature ranges vary by model. In some models, temperatures can range from
35°C (95°F) on the lowest setting to 70 °C (160 °F) on the highest setting.
●Portable saunas and sauna blankets allow the athlete’s head to be exposed to
ambient air thereby presenting greater opportunities for sweat rate tracking and
implementing cooling strategies such as icing.
●Portable saunas/sauna blankets are easy to transport and have great utility, hence
their rapid adoption as an acute water loss modality.
●Carefully monitor the athlete’s core temperature during any type of sauna use to
prevent hyperthermia 40°C and 104°F.
```
#### 5.4.6.7.Mummy/burrito. Mummy wraps are a commonly utilized modality that entails

wrapping an athlete (apart from the head) in warm towels or a combination of thermal
mylar blankets with towels. Some combat athletes may or may not choose this approach.
Mummy wraps are often used in unison with other acute water loss techniques. Scientific
researchers have yet to thoroughly investigate this strategy and its efficacy, particularly as
an isolated strategy. Nevertheless, the aforementioned study by Conor and Eagan [ 181 ]
used wraps after two sequences of 20 min of hot water immersion. The athletes wrapped
in heavy clothing and blankets in a room (24–29 C) for 40 min after 20 min of hot water
immersion. The process of wrapping post hot water immersion did lead to additional

36 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


losses in body mass of 2.79 kg more than hot water immersion alone. Combined, 20 min
of hot water immersion and 40 min of wrap for a total of 60 min were performed and then
repeated. The athletes lost a total of 4.5 ± 0.7% of total body mass. Therefore, this
combination may be an effective approach for acute water loss ranging from 14 to 16 h
before weigh-in. Despite the efficiency of this technique, sports nutrition professionals
should proceed with care and attempt to cool the athletes when needed. Additionally, it is
recommended to monitor an athlete’s body temperature and water loss and use this
practice with the minimum applications and durations needed to achieve the desired loss
in body mass.

#### 5.4.7.8.Mummy wraps – practical applications.

```
●Though rarely used alone, the combination of other AWL modalities, such as training,
hot baths, sauna, etc., prior to mummying allows the insulated heat to be main-
tained, thus extending the duration of sweating while minimizing heat stress.
●Duration of mummying is highly variable but due to the reduced heat stress
compared to modalities such as a hot bath/sauna, longer durations of 15–30 min
are common.
●Carefully monitor the athletes core temperature during any combination of hot
baths, sauna, and mummying to prevent hyperthermia, 40°C and 104°F.
```
#### 5.4.6.9.Floating. Respiratory water loss is water that is expelled via pulmonary ventila-

tion. Respiratory water is a byproduct of aerobic metabolism. Even in the absence of
visible perspiration, approximately one-half of water turnover occurs through what is
called insensible water loss, i.e. water lost from the lungs and skin [ 115 ]. Numerous factors
can influence the amount of respiratory water losses. For instance, in temperate environ-
ments, these losses are approximately equal to the amount of water generated through
aerobic metabolism: roughly 250–350 ml per day, increasing with respiratory rate as
exercise intensity increases [ 168 ]. Large decreases in humidity (e.g. 80% to 20%) can
significantly affect respiratory water losses, particularly during exercise where losses
increase from 0.8 to 2.7 mL/min [ 169 ]. However, it appears that altitude doese not
significantly alter respiratory water losses [ 188 ]. Oral exhalation compared to nasal
exhalation also increases net respiratory water losses by up to 46% [ 189 ]. In practice,
the ability to acutely manipulate this small amount of water relative to other forms of
water manipulation strategies is minimal. Nonetheless, insensible water loss from respira-
tory water losses is often factored into acute water loss strategies and commonly coined
the term “floating.” Increasing a combat athlete’s exposure to low humidity environments
in the days leading to weigh-ins or particularly during sleep may provide an increase in
water loss [ 152 ]. While the capacity for water loss through respiration is limited, particu-
larly when floating at nighttime, combat athletes often require fluid losses in terms of
ounces in the latest stages of acute water loss practices to successfully arrive at the
required weight to compete.

#### 5.4.7. Fight week weigh-in protocols

The allotted recovery window between weigh-ins and competition dictates the magni-
tude of acute water loss. As noted, several combat sports disciplines require same-day
weigh-ins with limited recovery windows. Olympic sports such as wrestling and Tae kwon
do are such examples, as well as most of the governing bodies regulating jiu-jitsu

competitions. Accordingly, rapid weight-loss strategies have diminished value to the
athlete when the window of time available to replenish fluid and electrolyte losses is
less than 4 h. Moreover, sports such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu and wrestling may have an athlete
on the mat well within 2 h of their official weigh-in, depending on their weight class and
how the competition is structured. As such, recovery windows that are short make it
harder for meaningful rehydration and refueling to occur if excessive weight cuts are
adopted. Therefore, careful planning to maintain an appropriate weight during the
general preparation phases becomes of greater significance. Moreover, the longitudinal
weight descent must be carefully designed to allow the athlete to decrease as much body
mass as possible via changes in body composition and reductions in body fat. It is
imperative to have the proper planning of total calories and macronutrient distributions
coupled with training volumes. Based upon anecdotal observations from the authors
working with thousands of combat athletes, below are recommended percentages of
body mass loss that may be most appropriate for varying lengths of time between weigh-
in and competition.

#### 6. Weigh-In Recovery

Prior to competition, combat athletes have their body mass verified by an official “weigh-
in” to ensure that they meet the weight requirements for the competitive division. As
noted, the time span between official weigh-ins varies among different combat sports,
athletic commissions, promotions, and competition levels with recovery windows span-
ning 15 min up to 36 h. Considering this, combat athletes utilize an array of rapid weight
loss and acute water loss strategies to manipulate their body mass, allowing them to
compete in a lower weight class in hopes of attaining a physical size advantage [ 6 ]. When
rapid weight loss and acute water loss strategies are conducted appropriately, sustain-
ably, and safely, the physiological consequences and performance/health impairment can
be reversed or mitigated by adopting effective post weigh-in nutrition and hydration
recovery tactics. Key considerations for post weigh-in recovery include rehydration,
glycogen restoration and gastrointestinal distress management [ 6 ].

#### 6.1. Post weigh-in – rehydration

Olympic combat athletes commonly lose ~5% of their body mass in the week prior to
weigh-ins [ 107 ], with professional MMA athletes in the UFC losing approximately 4.4% of
their body mass 24 h before weigh-ins [ 177 ]. To reverse the physiological consequences of
dehydration [ 190 , 191 ], a post weigh-in rehydration plan must consider the amount of
weight lost from dehydration (i.e. sweat losses). General sports nutrition recommenda-
tions suggest replacing 125–150% of the fluid lost from sweat [ 192 ]. However, replacing
such a large volume of fluid is attainable for recovery periods of 24–36 h, but it is often
impractical for smaller recovery periods such as same-day weigh-ins.
To facilitate fluid assimilation, ingested fluids must first be consumed and emptied into
the stomach, absorbed through the small intestines, and then enter the bloodstream.
Several factors can influence gastric emptying, including energy density, volume of fluid
bolus, fluid ingestion rate, osmolality, and pH [ 193 ]. Although gastric emptying rates can
vary from person to person, they generally level off around 600 ml, with larger volumes
(>1,000 ml) resulting in slower emptying [ 194 ]. Another important consideration is the
reduced gastric emptying rate that occurs after intense exercise [ 195 ], hypohydration
exceeding 3% of body mass [149], and the common practice of reducing food and fluid
intake before weigh-ins. Taking these factors into account, for combat athletes under-
going acute weight loss from hypohydration greater than 3% of body mass, it is recom-
mended to start with a conservative initial bolus of approximately 300–500 mL of fluid
immediately after the official weigh-ins, followed by additional volumes (~240–350 mL) at
regular intervals (every 30 min) to maintain gastric volume.
Post weigh-in rehydration should meet the electrolyte replacement needs of combat
athletes. Electrolytes lost through thermoregulatory sweat losses are primarily sodium
and chloride [ 192 ]; thus, replacing these key electrolytes allows for the optimal restoration
of osmolality and fluid volume. Estimating total sodium losses from sweat can be challen-
ging due to the large variations amongst individuals, however this typically ranges
around ~20–80 mmol/dL [ 196 ]. This can be further complicated by the common practice
among combat athletes of adopting a lower sodium diet prior to weigh-ins [ 6 ]. Despite
this, sodium content correlates with fluid retention. Therefore, oral rehydration solutions

```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 39
```

(ORS) with a sodium range of 50–90 mmol/dL [ 192 ] should be utilized when hypohydra-
tion is >3% of body mass. For hypohydration <3% of body mass, commercial sports drinks
(<30 mmol/dL sodium) result in adequate water retention. Rehydration can also be
monitored in part by tracking urination rate and color as well as measuring the athlete’s
weight as the rehydration protocol progresses.

#### 6.1.1. Post weigh-in carbohydrate

Carbohydrates are critical for the high-intensity nature of combat sports. Due to the
practice of glycogen depletion prior to weigh-in to facilitate rapid weight loss, glycogen
restoration following weigh-ins is desired [ 6 ]. Post weigh-in nutrition should include
adequate carbohydrate content to at least fuel the athlete for the competition and
maximize glycogen stores. Glycogen restoration must be carefully balanced and intro-
duced at a tolerable rate to reduce gut discomfort while being at a low enough energy
density to not hamper gastric emptying during the initial rehydration phase [ 194 ]. For this
reason, an oral rehydration solution with a 2–3% carbohydrate (e.g. 15 g/500 ml) solution
is more appropriate during rehydration for hypohydration >3% of body mass, whereas
sports drinks with a ~ 5% carbohydrate (e.g. 25 g/500 ml) solution is well tolerated for
hypohydration <3% of body mass.
With the initial oral rehydration solution and then solid foods, post weigh-in carbohy-
drate intake totaling 8–12 g/kg is appropriate for combat athletes that underwent sig-
nificant glycogen depletion to facilitate rapid weight loss prior to weigh-ins. This range of
carbohydrate ingestion is suitable for maximizing liver and skeletal muscle stores.
However, if greater glycogen depletion has not occurred then aggressive carbohydrate
intake is not necessary, and combat athletes may simply adopt a more moderate post
weigh-in carbohydrate intake ranging 4–7 g/kg [ 6 ].
Strategies to meet carbohydrate needs post weigh-in include high glycemic index
carbohydrates [ 197 ] and the use of carbohydrate rich fluids to simultaneously meet total
fluid needs while facilitating glycogen restoration [ 6 ]. When ingesting carbohydrates at
a rate of >60 g/h, incorporating food/fluids/supplements with a varied carbohydrate
source (e.g. glucose and fructose) facilitates carbohydrate absorption via multiple gut
transport mechanisms [ 198 ].

#### 6.1.2. Post weigh-in gastrointestinal distress management

Post weigh-in intake should prioritize optimizing nutritional status while avoiding GI
distress. Of the many dietary modifications used to elicit rapid weight loss, a low residue
diet has the most benign impact on performance and health [ 157 ]. In addition, fiber has
a minimal contribution to energy needs and reduces gastric emptying/absorption rates
and therefore the rapid reintroduction of fiber can cause discomfort [ 199 ] Fiber intake
post weigh-in contraindicated for optimal post weigh-in recovery and should be limited.
Protein and fat intake should be managed in the post weigh-in protocols as large boluses
may also delay gastric emptying.
In addition, gastrointestinal distress following weigh-ins can be limited by avoiding
trigger food/beverages during the acute rehydration phase (0–2 h following weigh-ins).
Currently, no literature on specific foods that cause GI distress in combat athletes exists.
However, certain foods are associated with gastrointestinal distress in both the general

40 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


population and athletes [ 200 , 201 ]. Thus, the authors suggest avoiding or minimizing
these foods:

```
●Coffee (independent of caffeine intake) relaxes lower esophageal sphincter.
●Citrus Fruits and Juices: lemon/lime, grapefruit and pineapple have high acid
content.
●Tomatoes: tomato juice, tomato-based pasta sauces have high acid content.
●Carbonated Beverages: gaseous distention of the stomach and increases pressure on
the lower esophageal sphincter causing reflux and bloating.
●Chocolate: contains compounds which relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter
●Peppermint, Garlic, Onion: relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter.
●Fatty, Spicy, Fried Food: delay gastric emptying and may exacerbate reflux symp-
toms, bloating and indigestion.
```
#### 7. Fight day strategies

Fight day-specific nutrition strategies are targeted for athletes with a 24–36-h recovery
window, as shorter recovery windows (<12 hr) are simply an extension of the weigh-in
recovery/fueling strategies discussed earlier. In theory, athletes with 24+ hour recovery
window adopt most (if not all) rapid weight loss and acute water loss strategies, including
carbohydrate depletion, sodium reduction, and low residue diets in addition to sweat
losses. At the same time, the long recovery window presents sufficient time for rehydra-
tion and refueling for peak performance. Fight day specific strategies can be summarized
as providing athletes the refueling needs in a form, dosage and ingestion rate that
minimizes gut disturbances yet meets and/or respects an athlete’s habits, traditions,
and performance needs.
Fight day macronutrient intake should consist primarily of carbohydrates, as high-
intensity sports (>70% VO2max) rely extensity upon carbohydrate as a fuel source [ 97 ].
Due to the range in competition times and variation in individual athlete sleep/recovery
needs, a simple yet effective calculation for estimating fight day carbohydrate needs is
1–4 g/kg of body mass [ 97 ]. Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index and easily diges-
tible starchy carbohydrates that an athlete habitually ingested throughout the prepara-
tion cycle are recommended. This may include (but not limited to): starchy tubers
(potatoes/sweet potato), rice and flour-based products (sourdough/pancakes/pastas).
Anxiety associated delays in-gastric emptying 2–3 h prior to competition may limit meal
bolus tolerance [ 202 ]. Strategies to meet carbohydrate needs can include liquid sources of
carbohydrates, e.g. sports drinks at 6–8% carbohydrate in addition to low volume carbo-
hydrate snacks (bars, pretzels, applesauce, dates, etc.).

```
(a)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 08:00 for a fight time of 14:00 has 6 h to
employ fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 6-h window, this athlete should ingest
between 210-280 g of carbohydrates.
(b)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 10:00 for a fight time of 22:00 has 12 h
to employ fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 12-h window, this athlete should
ingest between 420-560 g of carbohydrates.
```
```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 41
```

Protein intake can promote glycogen repletion, minimize muscle damage and promote
a positive nitrogen balance [ 97 ]. In addition, protein co-ingested with carbohydrates
before a training session/competition can promote glycogen repletion and prevent
reactive or rebound hypoglycemia [ 203 ]. As for a dosing strategy, a modest intake pre-
competition split into 20–30 g meal servings will meet protein needs without displacing
carbohydrate intake [ 97 ].

```
(a)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 08:00 for a fight time of 14:00 has 6 h to
employ fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 6-h window, this athlete should ingest
between 50-70 g of protein in 20-30 g/meal boluses.
(b)g. An athlete weighing 70 kg that wakes up at 10:00 for a fight time of 22:00 has 12 h
to employ fight day nutrition strategies. Given the 12-h window, this athlete should
ingest between 100-140 g of protein in 20-30 g/meal boluses.
```
Although calorically dense, fats are less of a priority due to the high-intensity nature of
combat sports. Rather than adding high fat sources to meals (e.g. cream sauces) or
ingesting fat-rich snacks (e.g. tree nuts), the fat calories should simply be a byproduct
of the food source itself (e.g. eggs). It should also be noted that due to reduced gastric
emptying effect of fats [ 204 ] compounded by pre-fight stress and anxiety [ 205 ], fat intake
should be avoided 3 h prior to competition.
Respecting athlete traditions and habits is of equal importance to performance nutri-
tion and gut tolerance-based fight day strategies. The sport nutrition professional should
maintain cultural competence when recommending fight day dietary strategies especially
for athletes of diverse cultures in a way that is effective and appropriate. Fight day dietary
strategies should consist of food and beverage options that are familiar and habitually
consumed through the athlete’s competition preparation. In addition, rigid and uncom-
promising fight day dietary strategy may fail to accommodate for the chaotic nature of
combat sports fight day logistics which may have frequent interruptions due to increased
sleep/recovery needs, preference for fight day “shakeouts” or training sessions, changes
to bout times/fight card logistics and unaccounted for anxiety-induced food intolerance.
A flexible approach utilizing an array of food and beverage sources that are easily
available, familiar and performance nutrition oriented is the best approach for meeting
an athlete’s fight day nutrition needs.

#### 7.1. Refueling and rehydration – practical applications

The following practical applications are based on rehydration strategies used in clinical
settings and current practices used by combat athletes [ 116 , 150 , 166 ].
Acute Rehydration (1–2 h post weigh-in)

```
●Utilize oral rehydration solution (1 to 1.5 liters per hour)
●Utilize fast-acting carbohydrates with low osmolarity at a tolerable rate of ≤60 grams
per hour.
●Re-introduce easily digestible starchy carbohydrates as tolerated (i.e. saltines, bagels,
rice cracker, etc.)
```
42 A. A. RICCI ET AL.


Non-acute Rehydration (3–6 h post weigh-ins)

```
●Fluid must contain electrolytes: primarily sodium, potentially also potassium and
chloride.
●Utilize simple and easily digestible starchy carbohydrates as tolerated (i.e. white rice,
potatoes, sweet potatoes, pasta, etc.)
```
Muscle Glycogen Restoration Phase (6+ hours Post Weigh-in)

```
●Prioritize carbohydrate intake, ingesting only low to moderate protein.
●Avoid high-fat foods, as these will delay gastric emptying. Eat small frequent meals,
rather than a single large bolus.
```
Weight Regain

```
●As the combat athlete refuels and rehydrates, monitor urination, urine color, and
increases in body mass.
●At least a 10% increase in body mass post weigh-in may be optimal for fight
performance and reducing health consequences.
```
#### 8. Final summary and conclusions

Combat sports encompass a range of tactics and skills that involve direct one-on-one
physical contact with the ultimate objective of overpowering, striking, or submitting
one’s opponent. These disciplines attract athletes at various levels, ranging from
recreational and amateur competitions to professional and Olympic events. One
distinguishing feature of combat sports is the implementation of weight divisions,
which serve to categorize athletes based on their body mass. This ensures that
competitors face opponents who are of comparable size and weight, promoting fair-
ness and safety in the sport. To compete in their desired weight class and potentially
gain a competitive edge, athletes resort to weight-loss practices that can be both
sustained/longitudinal and rapid. Accordingly, it is crucial to consider the nutritional
and weight cut strategies of training and competition in combat sports since they can
significantly impact an athlete’s performance and overall well-being. Distinct phases of
training, such as the general preparation/off camp, fight camp, and fight week, all
require specific strategies to optimize performance and support the athlete’s health.
When designing nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat athletes, factors such
as body mass, body composition, type of combat sport, duration of the fight camp,
and the time between weigh-in and the actual fight must be considered.
The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society. The Research
Committee of the Society has approved them:

```
(1)Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and
competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies
for training and competition.
```
```
JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 43
```

```
(2)As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 minutes, contribution of the
aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic
glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts.
(3)During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain
a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement.
(4)Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-
methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or
recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition.
(5)During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an
efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined
using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or
Cunningham.
(6)Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean
body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands.
Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0–4.0 g/kg,
protein 1.2–2.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day.
(7)Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at
24 h, prior to weigh-in.
(8)Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute
water loss.
(9)During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exer-
cise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1 to 2% loss in body mass, with
equivalent losses from a low fiber intake, <10 g/day for 4 days.
(10)During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immer-
sion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision
(optimally ~2–4% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in).
(11)Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/
mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage.
(12)Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-
90 mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in.
(13)Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of ≤ 60 grams/h should follow oral
rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid
gastrointestinal distress.
(14)Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8–12 g/kg may be appropriate for combat
athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight
week. 4-7 g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction.
(15)Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain ≥10% of body
mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss.
(16)The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are
unknown, necessitating further research.
