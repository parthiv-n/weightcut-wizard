•Combat (and other weight category) sports athletes commonly reduce body mass in an effort to compete in weight divisions below their day-to-day
training weight.
•Both chronic and acute weight losses (often in the form of extreme dehydration) are commonly used to “make weight.” These practices
correlate with competitive success in certain sports; however, they can be detrimental to one’s health and absolute physical performance if not
sensibly implemented.
•By strategically manipulating dietary intake of fiber, carbohydrate, sodium and fluid, athletes can minimize the requirement for sweating to make
weight and the associated health risks of excessive dehydration.
•Athletes should develop a thorough understanding of the optimal nutritional strategies involved in recovery and combine them with practices
identified as making them “feel good.” Preferably, they should focus on suitable carbohydrate sources and appropriate fluid intakes in the form of
familiar foods trialed ahead of competition.
•Athletes should plan their weight-making strategy ahead of time and practice this prior to important competitions. Furthermore, athletes should
evaluate and refine their weight-making and recovery practices from competition to competition.
## INTRODUCTION
In most combat sports, competitors are separated into weight divisions
in  an  attempt  to  “create  an  even  playing  field.”  Prior  to  competition,
athletes  must  attend  an  official  “weigh-in”  and  have  their  body  mass
(BM)  verified  to  ensure  they  have  “made  weight.”  The  period  of  time
between  weigh-in  and  competition  differs  between  combat  sports;
however, a recovery period of at least 3 and up to 24 h exists among
the Olympic combat sports and an even greater time (> 30 h) may be
available  in  professional  combat  sports.  Most  fighters  try  to  take
advantage of this scenario by using acute weight loss (AWL) strategies
(cutting  weight)  in  the  hours  and  days  before  weigh-in,  temporarily
lowering their BM to make weight at a lower division than their day-to-
day  weight  (and  thus  compete  against  smaller  opponents).  Athletes
then  attempt  to  reverse  the  negative  performance  effects  of  AWL
during  the  recovery  period  (Franchini  et  al.,  2012).  Indeed,  there  is
indirect  evidence  indicating  AWL  increases  success  in  some  combat
sports  (Franchini  et  al.,  2012;  Reale  et  al.,  2017a).  Thus  if  sensibly
implemented,  and  adequate  post  weigh-in  recovery  opportunities
exist,  cutting  weight  might  be  seen  as  a  pragmatic  way  to  optimize
competitiveness.
It needs to be stated that severe health consequences (including death
[Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  1998])  may  arise  from
extreme and excessive AWL. Thus, the magnitude and methods of AWL
need to be managed in such a way as to minimize potential negative
consequences.  Although  some  have  called  for  the  abolishment  of
weight   cutting,   until   such   time   that   regulations   specifically   and
systematically prohibit the practice, it appears athletes will continue to
cut   weight.   Therefore,   sports   nutrition   professionals   need   to
pragmatically  balance  athletes’  desires  to  achieve  (real  or  perceived)
advantages  with  concerns  for  their  physical,  mental  and  emotional
safety.  This  means  advising  against  excessively  large  magnitudes  of
weight loss and educating both athletes and coaches to make use of
less  harmful,  evidenced-based  methods  of  weight  loss,  as  well  as
optimizing recovery.
## ACHIEVABLE MAGNITUDES OF SAFE ACUTE
## WEIGHT LOSS
Combat sport athletes commonly lose ≥ 5% BM in the week prior to
weigh-in (Franchini et al., 2012). Under some conditions, achieving 5%
and up to 8% BM losses alongside acceptably small impacts on health
and performance may be possible (Reale et al., 2016, 2017a). However,
an  appreciation  of  optimized  methods  of  AWL,  as  well  as  a  realistic
assessment of one’s “starting point” prior to AWL is required. Utilizing
solely  dehydration  to  achieve  5-8%  BM  loss  is  inadvisable  and
dangerous to health. Instead, a calculated manipulation of gut content,
carbohydrate stores and finally body water should be utilized in order to
achieve  the  desired  AWL.  Therefore,  the  starting  point  prior  to  AWL
should  represent  a  BM  associated  with  a  euhydrated,  well-nourished
state,  which  allows  an  opportunity  for  sizeable  manipulation  of  these
compartments.  Lastly,  the  recovery  time  available  post  weigh-in/pre-
competition will further determine the magnitude of AWL achievable if
one wants to present to competition in an acceptable state. As a guide,
with greater than 12 h between weigh-in and competition (e.g., sports
which conduct weigh-ins the day before competition), a fully hydrated,
well-nourished athlete may lose and recover from up to 8% BM (Reale
et  al.,  2016).  Those  weighing-in  the  morning  of  competition  (with
limited recovery time, e.g. ≤
## ~
6 h) should aim for no more than 5% BM
acute losses (Reale et al., 2016).

## METHODS TO ACHIEVE SAFE ACUTE WEIGHT LOSS
Manipulation of Gut Content
Combat sport athletes commonly fast, limit portion sizes or reduce total
food volume prior to weigh-in to reduce the mass of intestinal contents
and  thus  total  BM  (Brito  et  al.,  2012;  Fleming  &  Costarelli,  2007;
Franchini et al., 2012). Laxative and bowel preparation formula use is
common  among  weight  category  sport  athletes  (Brito  et  al.,  2012;
Franchini  et  al.,  2012).  While  this  method  is  effective  in  removing
intestinal bulk and cleansing the bowel, this will also impact energy and
macronutrient  intake/absorption,  and  has  been  shown  to  reduce
exercise  capacity  (Holte  et  al.,  2004).  Therefore,  dietary  strategies
which   reduce   total   food   volume   without   impacting   energy   and
macronutrient intake (i.e., the consumption of low weight, energy dense
foods  in  the  hours  and  days  prior  to  weigh-in)  are  preferable.  This  is
especially  true  for  athletes  who  have  limited  time  to  effectively
rehydrate and refuel prior to competition (due to limited recovery time
post weigh-in).
Certain types of dietary fiber can both slow gut transit times of foods as
well as draw water into the intestinal space, “bulking” stools. Different
foods possess different fecal bulking properties (Monro, 2000), thus if
one reduces the consumption of “bulking” fiber-rich foods, a reduction
of  undigested  plant  matter  within  the  gut  and  a  reduction  in  water
drawn into the intestinal space follows. This decreases fecal bulk, total
gut contents and overall BM. In fact, a linear relationship exists between
fiber intake and bowel cleanliness. The consumption of a low fiber diet
for  just  two  days  begins  cleansing  the  bowel  (Wu  et  al.,  2011),  with
seven  days  being  as  effective  as  a  bowel  preparation  formula,  while
resulting  in  less  physiological  stress  than  bowel  preparation  formulas
(Lijoi et al., 2009).
Limited research examining low fiber diets in the context of AWL exists,
and  whole  gut  transit  times  vary  widely  between  individuals  from
10-96 h (Lee et al., 2014). Therefore, precise guidelines for the use of
fiber  restriction  for  AWL  cannot  presently  be  determined.  However,
indirect evidence suggests significant weight loss (
## ~
1.5% BM), in line
with that following bowel preparation formula use (Holte et al., 2004),
is achieved following 48 h of fiber restriction (≤ 10 g/d), with no further
significant losses in most individuals (Reale et al., 2017b). Thus, 48 h
seems a sensible starting point to implement this approach, noting that
individual responses may vary and some individuals may benefit from a
restriction > 48 h.
Manipulation of Glycogen Content
Dietary  carbohydrate  is  stored  in  skeletal  muscle  and  the  liver  as
glycogen  and  these  energy  reserves  can  be  mobilized  to  meet  the
demand  for  glucose.  Glycogen  is  noted  to  bind  to  water  at  a  ratio  of
1:2.7  (Bergström  &  Hultman,  1972).  Given  the  substantial  glycogen
storage capacity of athletes, and the ability to manipulate these stores
(Burke & Deakin, 2009), this represents another AWL strategy available
to  the  weight  category  sport  athlete.  Both  the  restriction  of  dietary
carbohydrate  coupled  with  glycogen  demanding  training,  and  the
increase  of  training  alongside  one’s  habitual  carbohydrate  intake,  will
result  in  changes  in  glycogen  status.  Prior  to  weigh-in/competition,
athletes tend to decrease (not increase) training, and therefore reducing
(or   restricting   altogether)   carbohydrate   intake   without   increasing
training in order to deplete glycogen stores would be a logical strategy.
It  has  been  shown  that  7  d  of  a  low  carbohydrate  diet  (<  50  g/d),
combined with training and a minor energy deficit (< 10%) can achieve
a ~2% BM reduction while maintaining strength, power and anaerobic
capacity measures (Sawyer et al., 2013). However, the exact magnitude
of possible BM loss, the degree of carbohydrate restriction and the time
frame required, will depend on one’s glycogen status and training load
prior to dietary restriction. A general recommendation of < 50 g/d for
3-7  d  for  combat  sport  athletes  wanting  to  deplete  glycogen  prior  to
weigh-in  has  been  suggested  (Reale  et  al.,  2016).  Athletes  should
consider the time available post weigh-in to refuel and the requirements
of  their  sport  (i.e.,  fuel  demands,  need  for  repeated  weigh-ins,  etc.)
when deciding whether to utilize glycogen depletion (and to what extent)
as a means to achieve AWL.
Manipulation of Body Water
Water constitutes ~60% of the human body (Sawka et al., 2005) in the
general population and likely more in athletes due to higher amounts of
lean mass. Given the size of this body compartment and the short time
frame in which fluctuations can occur, it is no surprise that dehydration
is  the  primary  AWL  strategy  used  by  many  combat  sport  athletes.
Although  mild  dehydration  (<  2%  BM)  is  unlikely  to  affect  relevant
performance, larger magnitudes may be problematic, particularly when
limited time to rehydrate post weigh-in exists (Reale, 2016, 2017a). Put
simply, athletes have two methods available to them to decrease body
water;  consume  less  fluid  and/or  excrete  more  fluid.  A  24  h  fluid
restriction (< 300 ml (10 oz)) may result in 1.5-2% BM loss (James &
Shirreffs,  2013);  however,  athletes  commonly  achieve  losses  greater
than this following increased sweating via both active (exercise induced)
and/or  passive  methods  (i.e.,  saunas,  heated  environments,  etc.)
(Franchini et al., 2012).
It is important to note the differing physiological responses of passive
and  active  sweating.  Passive  sweating  prior  to  exercise  decreases
plasma volume, sweat rate and stroke volume, contributing to increased
serum  osmolality,  heart  rate  and  body  heat  storage,  whereas  this
happens  to  a  lesser  extent  following  active  sweating  (Walsh  et  al.,
1994). Therefore, a combination of fluid restriction and active sweating
(preferably accompanying existing training sessions in the hours or day
prior to weigh-in) may be the most pragmatic, performance preserving
method  to  achieve  AWL  via  dehydration.  Additional  passive  sweating
should only be used when necessary and when sufficient recovery time
is available. If using a sauna to facilitate perspiration, dry heat should be
used  in  preference  to  steam  saunas,  as  this  results  in  greater  fluid
losses for a given period of time and less physiological strain (Pilch et
al., 2014).

Lastly, reductions in sodium intake may also result in body water losses,
resulting  from  renal  attempts  to  maintain  osmotic  pressure,  achieved
through the excretion and retention of both electrolytes and fluid. BM
losses  of  1-2%  have  been  reported  in  hypertensive  subjects  who
switched to a low sodium (< 500 mg) diet for 5 days (He et al., 2001);
however, no interim BM measures were taken, so it is not possible to
state the exact time frame of weight loss. Furthermore, whether or not
similar  losses  would  occur  in  normotensive  subjects  is  unknown.
Despite  the  lack  of  definitive  evidence,  reductions  in  sodium  intake
during  AWL  are  common  (Fleming  &  Costarelli,  2007),  and  perhaps
even if a reduction in sodium intake may not influence total body water
per  se,  when  used  in  combination  with  other  fluid  manipulation
strategies  it  may  “release”  more  body  water  and  allow  a  reduction  in
BM (Reale et al., 2016).
## POST WEIGH-IN RECOVERY NUTRITION
Any advantage gained from cutting weight leading into competition will
be  best  maximized  by  enacting  a  calculated  recovery  plan  following
weigh-in. Priorities following weigh-in may include rehydration, glycogen
restoration and the management of gastrointestinal distress.
## Rehydration
Combat sport athletes should aim to restore fluid losses to within ~2%
of “pre-hypohydration” BM in order to minimize negative performance
effects (Burke & Deakin, 2009; Walsh et al., 1994). Factors which may
prohibit  the  attainment  of  this  goal  include  insufficient  recovery  time
and difficulty in accurately identifying the magnitude of hypohydration,
since acute changes in BM (traditionally thought to mirror fluid losses)
will likely be made up of more than solely body water. Adequate recovery
time following weigh-ins conducted the day before competition is likely;
however, this may not be the case for those weighing-in the morning of
competition. Therefore, those who weigh-in the morning of competition
may  best  manage  BM  by  preventing  the  need  to  lose  >  3%  BM  via
dehydration in order to make weight (Reale et al., 2016, 2017a).
General  sports  nutrition  recommendations  suggest  125-150%  of  any
fluid  deficit  needs  to  be  ingested  to  compensate  for  continued  urine
losses (Shirreffs & Maughan, 1998; Maughan & Leiper, 1999; Burke &
Deakin, 2009). In certain situations, this may be difficult to implement
since the true fluid deficit may be unknown (e.g., “non-fluid” AWL may
confound the typical use of BM changes in estimating hypohydration)
and large fluid volumes may be impractical to consume during limited
recovery time. In addition to fluid volumes larger than losses, athletes
can  further  enhance  rehydration  efforts  post  weigh-in  via  additional
strategies.
Consuming a large fluid bolus ~600-900 mL (20-30 oz) immediately
post  weigh-in  as  well  as  additional  boluses  at  regular  intervals  will
maintain a high gastric volume, in turn speeding gastric emptying and
potentially preventing the need to consume fluids closer to competition
(Maughan & Leiper, 1999).
Sweat losses are comprised of not only fluid but electrolytes, primarily
sodium and chloride (Maughan & Leiper, 1999). Thus, replacement of
these  electrolytes  will  promote  restoration  of  plasma  osmolality  and
volume.  Sweat  sodium  concentrations  range  from  ~20-80  mmol/L
(Shirreffs & Maughan, 1998; Maughan & Leiper, 1999, Burke & Deakin,
2009),  making  it  difficult  to  prescribe  one  “optimal”  sodium  con-
centration  for  a  rehydration  beverage.  However,  fluid  retention  does
correlate with sodium content due to both electrolyte replacement and
the  effects  on  intestinal  absorption  (Maughan  &  Leiper,  1999).  This
occurs following both the consumption of salty foods alongside fluids
(Ray  et  al.,  1998)  and  sodium  containing  fluids  alone.  Sports  drinks
typically  contain  <  30  mmol/L  sodium,  whereas  oral  rehydration
solutions (ORS), commonly used in the treatment of acute diarrhea or
vomiting  contain  50-90  mmol/L  sodium  (Maughan  &  Leiper,  1999;
Burke, 2009). Thus, consuming beverages with additional sodium may
be  the  best  option  when  rehydration  is  the  priority.  Alternatively,
consuming salty snacks alongside sports drinks will increase the total
sodium load ingested, thereby increasing fluid retention. In this scenario,
consideration  needs  to  be  given  to  the  fact  that  increased  energy
derived from any food consumed concurrent to a sports drink will slow
gastric  emptying  (Maughan  et  al.,  1996).  Lastly,  fluid  restriction  (as
opposed  to  dehydration  following  sweating)  causes  a  decrease  in  net
body  water  without  the  same  electrolyte  losses  (James  &  Shirreffs,
2013).  Therefore,  electrolyte  replacement  is  less  important  in  this
situation and lower sodium fluids will be well retained.
## Glycogen Restoration
Fully  saturated  glycogen  stores  may  not  be  required  for  optimal
performance in combat sports; however, incomplete glycogen depletion
impaired anaerobic exercise lasting ~5 min, and performance improve-
ments following glycogen-loading in predominantly anaerobically fueled
scenarios have also been noted (Pizza et al., 1995). Furthermore, BM
gain  (a  consequence  of  glycogen  loading)  (Sawyer  et  al.,  2013)  may
indirectly increase competitive success (Franchini et al., 2012; Reale et
al., 2017a). Therefore, post weigh-in recovery nutrition should include
enough carbohydrate to at least provide adequate fuel for competition
needs,  and  potentially  maximize  glycogen  stores  (if  time  permits  and
intake  does  not  interfere  with  rehydration  or  gastrointestinal  (GI)
comfort).
General  sports  nutrition  guidelines  prescribe  carbohydrate  intakes  of

to maximize glycogen storage (Burke & Deakin, 2009;
Burke  et  al.,  2017).  Taking  into  consideration  tapered  training  and
allowing   for   potential   carbohydrate   loading,   a   post   weigh-in
recommendation  of  5-10  g/kg  BM  encompasses  both  goals.  Those
with  limited  recovery  time  and/or  those  wanting  to  avoid  potential  GI
discomfort may want to aim for the lower end of this range, whereas
athletes with extended recovery times and/or the desire to increase BM
would likely benefit from consuming at the higher end. Selecting high
glycemic  index  carbohydrate  and/or  carbohydrate-rich  fluids  (which
## S
ports Science Exchange (2018) Vol. 31, No. 183, 1-6
## 3

simultaneously  aide  in  rehydration  efforts)  may  reduce  GI  discomfort
commonly  associated  with  the  consumption  of  solid  foods  close  to
competition  (Burke  &  Deakin,  2009;  Reale  et  al.,  2017a).  Adding
protein to recovery meals/snacks may increase glycogen storage when
carbohydrate intake is sub-optimal (Ivy et al., 2002; Burke et al., 2017).
Consideration needs to be given to rehydration however, as hypertonic
fluids (e.g., fluids > 10% carbohydrate) may decrease the rate of gastric
emptying  and  rehydration,  as  well  as  affect  GI  comfort  (Evans  et  al.,
2009). Therefore, at times, athletes may need to determine which takes
priority between rehydration and refueling, as focusing on one may limit
their ability to achieve the other.
## Managing Gastrointestinal Distress
Ideally, post weigh-in intake should fully recover nutritional status while
avoiding GI distress. Of the aforementioned AWL strategies, a low fiber
diet is likely the least harmful (Reale et al., 2016). In contrast to depleted
glycogen  and  dehydration,  reduced  GI  bulk  is  not  thought  to  be
performance limiting, providing energy intake is adequate (Reale et al.,
2016). Thus, BM loss by reducing gut contents does not require acute
replacement,  and  recovery  should  focus  on  replacement  of  fluid  and
carbohydrate as dictated by acute losses. In fact, a sudden reintroduction
of   dietary   fiber   slows   gastric   emptying   and   nutrient   absorption
(Hillemeier,  1995),  potentially  producing  GI  discomfort  (Mahan  &
Escott-Stump, 2008). The same occurs with large fat intakes (Mahan
& Escott-Stump, 2008). Thus, dietary fiber and fat should be limited as
consumption  post  weigh-in  not  only  displaces  other  more  important
nutrients   but   may   impair   competition   performance   directly   and
indirectly.  This  consideration  is  heightened  when  the  recovery  period
is limited.
Some athletes that are worried about GI distress (potentially worsened
by gut contact during competition), may feel unable to consume solid
foods  or  even  energy  containing  fluids  pre-event.  For  these  (and  all)
athletes,  there  are  options  which  may  enhance  performance  without
aggravating GI symptoms. Both caffeine use, and “mouth rinsing” and
spitting  of  a  carbohydrate  based  solution  or  food  is  known  to  aide
performance  during  times  of  low  carbohydrate  availability  (Kasper  et
al., 2016).
Becoming  familiar  with  individual  responses  to  caffeine  is  important;
however,  in  general,  the  dose  response  relationship  with  caffeine
follows a U-shaped curve. That is; mild to moderate doses (3-6 mg/kg)
consumed 60 min pre-exercise elicits desirable effects, and increasing
doses cause over stimulation, anxiety and potential decrements in fine
motor control (Burke & Deakin, 2009).
Although no specific combat sports data exists, based on the current
literature in comparable as well as wider scenarios, rinsing the mouth
for ~10 s with a sports drink (or other carbohydrate solution or food)
pre-competition may enhance performance (Burke & Maughan, 2015;
Kasper  et  al.,  2016).  This  represents  a  low  risk  strategy  potentially
providing increased drive, due to the activation of regions or responses
in the central nervous system which may increase corticomotor activity
and/or reduce perception of effort, at a time when athletes may want to
avoid swallowing foods or fluids (Burke & Maughan, 2015).
## PRE-COMPETITION NUTRITION
In  most  sports,  pre-competition  nutrition  involves  a  “fine  tuning”  of
nutritional  status  alongside  the  pursuit  of  comfort,  routine  and  ritual
practices and not the aggressive reversal of weight-making efforts. This
represents another challenge for the combat sport athlete. Ideally, full
recovery  of  nutritional  status  (following  AWL)  will  occur  several  hours
before   competition,   allowing   one   to   focus   on   “traditional”   pre-
competition practices. When there is limited recovery time post weigh-
in  or  when  excessive  AWL  has  occurred,  incorporating  these  two
themes can be challenging. Consequently, the shorter the time interval
between  weigh-in  and  competition,  the  less  weight  an  athlete  should
attempt to lose/gain acutely.
Increased  carbohydrate  availability  in  the  hours  prior  to  exercise  is  a
well-recognized strategy to improve performance across multiple sports
(Lambert  et  al.,  1991,  Burke  &  Deakin,  2009).  Determining  specific
pre-fight  meal  prescriptions  is  challenging  at  this  stage;  however,
carbohydrate intakes ≥ 1g/kg in the hours before exercise are noted to
assist repeated high intensity efforts (Lambert et al., 1991). Although
athletes’  individual  preferences  must  be  considered,  easily  digested,
low-fat,  low-fiber  carbohydrate-rich  foods  before  and  between  bouts
would seem ideal (Reale et al., 2017a, Burke & Deakin, 2009).
## MANAGING POST WEIGH-IN RECOVERY, GUT COMFORT
## AND COMPETITION NUTRITION CONCURRENTLY
Post weigh-in, there is a “crossover” time point where nutrition priorities
change from recovery to competition (nutritional, mental and physical)
preparation.  For  athletes  who  weigh-in  the  day  prior  to  competition,
achieving recovery goals prior to sleep makes sense, thus permitting a
focus on competition preparation upon waking. For athletes weighing in
on the morning of competition, isolating this crossover point is harder
and is likely dictated predominantly by a desire to avoid gut discomfort
and other anxieties surrounding the pre-competition period.
Assessment  of  recovery  requirements  and  preparation  of/access  to
appropriate fluids and foods should take place ahead of time, allowing
recovery to begin immediately post weigh-in. There may be a conflict
between  rehydration  goals  where  lower  osmolality/energy  beverages
enhance   gastric   emptying   and   nutrient   restoration   goals   where
aggressive carbohydrate replenishment may slow gastric emptying. In
this situation, athletes may need to make specific decisions regarding
nutrition  priorities.  Fighters  commonly  select  fluids  in  the  period
immediately (30-60 min) post-weigh-in, thus ingestion of an ORS (or a
high sodium containing sports drink) may be a suitable choice for those
prioritizing rehydration, whereas traditional sports drinks, gels, chews
and  candy  or  other  high  glycemic  index  foods  that  are  portable  and
easily digested carbohydrate sources provide a post weigh-in solution

## 4

targeted  toward  fueling.  Further,  liquid  boluses  aimed  to  maximize
gastric volume/emptying could include sweetened milk to provide pro-
tein  and  carbohydrate  simultaneously  and  thus  address  additional
nutrition goals, but again decisions may need to be made regarding the
importance of recovering fluid vs. carbohydrate/energy.
In the second hour of recovery, athletes may wish to begin solid food
consumption. Carbohydrate-rich, low fiber, low fat selections will best
promote  glycogen  storage  while  lessening  potential  GI  discomfort.
Continuing fluid intake during this time is also important, but if water is
consumed  alongside  sodium-rich  foods,  electrolyte-containing  bever-
ages  may  not  be  required  (Maughan  et  al.,  1996).  In  reality,  many
common foods are either high in sodium and/or easy to add salt to, and
are suitable as recovery meals (Ray et al., 1998). When controlling food
composition is difficult and/or an athlete does not want to/or cannot eat
a larger meal, continuing to drink an ORS to address hydration alongside
sugar-rich  snacks  or  sports  foods  will  address  carbohydrate  requir-
ements. Similarly, many sports drinks are convenient choices for mod-
erate rates of rehydration and refueling. However, some have lower than
optimal sodium contents for facilitating rapid rehydration, so consuming
salty snacks concurrently will further support fluid retention. Proactive
strategies  addressing  rehydration  and  glycogen  replenishment  should
continue until recovery is achieved (e.g., consumption of 125-150% of
fluid deficit and adequate carbohydrate) or until continued consumption
causes GI distress or interferes with competition preparation.
## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS AND SUMMARY
Weight cutting in combat sports is a contentious issue. It may indirectly
increase  competitive  success  while  concurrently  decreasing  absolute
performance  and  presenting  a  health  risk.  Athletes  should  familiarize
themselves with the associated risks and the evidenced based methods
to manage them. Avoiding extreme magnitudes of acute weight (and in
particular body water) fluctuations will best preserve performance and
health. Table 1 summarizes key pre and post weigh-in nutrition recom-
mendations,  but  it  must  be  noted  that  exact  requirements  will  vary
based  on  magnitude  of  weight  loss  required,  recovery  time  frame
available post weigh-in, and requirements of the sport. Combat sport
athletes  are  advised  to  develop  a  plan  that  includes  well-practiced
routines,  as  well  as  continually  evaluating  and  refining  AWL  and
recovery processes throughout their career. For further detailed recom-
mendations, readers are directed to existing acute weight loss (Reale et
al., 2016) and recovery/pre-competition (Reale et al., 2017a) reviews.

Table 1. Key pre weigh-in acute weight loss and post weigh-in recovery/pre
competition dietary recommendations
Pre Weigh-In Acute
## Weight Loss
Post Weigh-In Recovery
## / Pre Competition
## Carbohydrate
Maintain habitual intake if
glycogen depletion is not
a goal
## OR
< 50 g/d for 3-7 d if
glycogen depletion is a goal
1 g/kg BM 2-3 h prior to
competition
## +
5-10 g/kg BM post weigh-in
(if glycogen depletion has
occurred)
## Fluid
Decreased 24 h prior to
weigh-in
(Exact degree of fluid
restriction/ requirement
for additional sweating will
depend on magnitude of
fluid loss required)
125-150% of fluid losses
Consumed as 600-900
ml (20-30 oz) bolus
immediately post weigh-in,
with remainder consumed at
regular intervals (every ~15-
20 min) while GI comfort
persists
Sodium< 500 mg/d
≥ 50 mmol/L
(if consuming only fluid)
## OR
≥ 1150 mg (from either
food and/or fluid) for every
liter (34 oz) of fluid
Fiber< 10 g/d< 10 g/d
