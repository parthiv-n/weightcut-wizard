## Abstract:
Nutritional ergogenic aids (NEAs) are substances included within the group of sports
supplements. Although they are widely consumed by athletes, evidence-based analysis is required to
support training outcomes or competitive performance in specific disciplines. Combat sports have a
predominant use of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, reaching peak exertion or sustained
effort for very short periods of time. In this context, the use of certain NEAs could help athletes to
improve their performance in those specific combat skills (i.e., the number of attacks, throws and
hits; jump height; and grip strength, among others) as well as in general physical aspects (time to
exhaustion [TTE], power, fatigue perception, heart rate, use of anaerobic metabolism, etc.).  Med-
line/PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO were searched from their inception to May 2022 for randomised
controlled trials (RCTs). Out of 677 articles found, 55 met the predefined inclusion criteria. Among
all the studied NEAs, caffeine (5–10 mg/kg) showed strong evidence for its use in combat sports to
enhance the use of glycolytic pathways for energy production during high-intensity actions due to
a greater production of and tolerance to blood lactate levels. In this regard, abilities including the
number of attacks, reaction time, handgrip strength, power and TTE, among others, were improved.
Buffering supplements such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate and beta-alanine may have a
promising role in high and intermittent exertion during combat, but more studies are needed in
grappling combat sports to confirm their efficacy during sustained isometric exertion. Other NEAs,
including creatine, beetroot juice or glycerol, need further investigation to strengthen the evidence
for performance enhancement in combat sports.  Caffeine is the only NEA that has shown strong
evidence for performance enhancement in combat sports.

## 1. Introduction
The different disciplines of combat sports have as common elements the involvement
of explosive and high-intensity movements of both the upper and lower limbs. They are
executed in rounds or bouts of a short duration (seconds to minutes), the objective of which
will be conditioned by the specific combat sport and its rules [1]. Performance in combat
sports is determined by the acquisition of a physical and physiological profile appropriate
to the characteristics of each discipline [2]. The requirements of combat sports involve a
great technical record and a high number of repetitions at high intensity, which are inter-
spersed with moments of low intensity. The energetic demands of these sports show a high
involvement of aerobic metabolism. However, high-intensity actions require the involve-
ment of anaerobic metabolism (the ability to produce energy by intramuscular adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine and/or anaerobic glycolysis during short duration
exercise) [1], represented by elevated blood lactate levels after competition [2].

The magnitudes of strength involved differ among combat sports. On the one hand,
those with predominantly punching movements, such as punches and kicks, have a greater
need for explosive strength and power; on the other hand, those with grappling actions
may require a greater emphasis on isometric and concentric muscle strength.  Likewise,
there are also differences according to the limbs that mainly develop the motor actions: in
sports such as boxing or judo, the upper limbs are mostly used; in taekwondo it is centred
on the lower limbs, while in karate both upper and lower limbs are used. In each of these
sports, specific equipment and clothing are used that, according to scientific literature,
could condition the technical aspects and even the physical demands of the athletes [2].
Depending on these characteristics, which are based, among others, on the rules of the
sport, combat sports can be categorised into two main groups: grappling and striking. In
addition, a third group involves both grappling and striking, namely mixed martial arts
## (MMA) [2].
Within the combat sports with grappling, there are sports in which gripping, throw-
ing, ground combat, chokeholds and joint locks are allowed. These sports include judo,
wrestling and jiu-jitsu [3,4]. Punching or striking sports include those in which the hands
(such as boxing), the legs (such as taekwondo) or both the hands and legs (such as karate)
are used [2]. On some occasions, namely non-Olympic modalities, knee and elbow strikes
are involved [5]. MMA allow both grappling and striking techniques following the specific
rules of this sport.  Similar to the previously mentioned sports, aerobic and anaerobic
metabolism are involved in the development of this discipline, due to the repetition of
high-intensity efforts and combining the demands of grappling and striking [6]. It is im-
portant to highlight that competitions in these disciplines are by weight category, which
are established to match combat sports athletes with similar physical characteristics and
thereby emphasise fair play. Most of the athletes try to reach the maximum (limit) weight
of the category.  In addition, inappropriate weight loss strategies may negatively affect
performance [7].
An ergogenic aid is defined as a psychological technique, mechanical device, nutri-
tional or pharmacological approach that can improve training adaptations and/or exercise
performance capacity [8]. Nutritional ergogenic aids (NEAs) are taken orally; they contain
nutritional ingredients whose objectives are to improve sports performance and to avoid
harmful effects on the individual (i.e., extraneous fatigue, dehydration and loss of physical
skills, among others) [9]. The consumption of NEAs has increased in recent years around
the world, despite a 32.1% decline in sports supplements sales in 2020, the first year of the
COVID-19 pandemic. It has been estimated that sports supplements sales will increase by
10–11% between 2022 and 2028 [10]. There are no differences in supplement consumption
by sex, but elite athletes usually take more dietary supplements than non-elite athletes [11].
There is no specific information about the consumption of supplements among combat
sports practitioners, but there is no doubt about the potential ergogenic effect of these
dietary supplements in specific sport modalities, because it is conditioned by the type of
effort executed [12,13]. However, proper counselling based on current scientific evidence
is required.
Several organisations such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Aus-
tralian Institute of Sport (AIS) have proposed classifications of sports supplements, group-
ing them into different categories according to safety, legality and effectiveness. Neverthe-
less, there are no policies regarding the regulation of alleged benefits and safety claims, so
in many cases, companies advertise their products without scientific evidence regarding
their effect, dose or instructions for use [14,15]. This systematic review and meta-analyses
aimed at evaluating the scientific evidence concerning NEAs in the improvement of the per-
formance of combat sports athletes specifically through published randomised controlled
trials (RCTs).

- Materials and Methods
The conduct and reporting of the current systematic review conforms to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [16]. Using MeSH
terms, three groups of combat sports were analysed regarding the efficacy of certain NEAs:
martial arts, boxing and wrestling.
## 2.1. Systematic Search
The electronic databases Medline, Scopus and EBSCO (Sportdiscus) were searched to
find relevant articles identified by title and abstract (from inception to 31 May 2022) using
the search strategy described in Table 1. To perform a complete search, reference lists from
reviews and relevant publications were manually searched to find additional publications
on the subject.

## 2.2. Data Extraction
Two  reviewers  (N.V.S.  and  E.F.M.)  independently  extracted  the  characteristics  of
the retrieved RCTs and the outcomes of interest from full-text articles.  A third author
(A.M.R.)  assessed  inter-reviewer  differences  (i.e.,  in  the  case  of  selecting  an  article  in
which the authors evaluated a multi-ingredient supplement to evaluate its synergy but
it  could  have  masked  the  real  effect  of  the  NEA).  The  following  data  were  extracted
using a predefined Microsoft Excel data extraction form: type of NEA, dose and time, the
number of participants within each group, participant age and sex, combat sport discipline,
measurement methods and main outcomes. This endeavour provided an overview table of
all eligible studies.
## 2.3. Study Selection
The inclusion criteria were: (a) no use of doping substances established by the WADA;
(b) an RCT design that included one group receiving NEAs and≥1 group(s) receiving a
placebo or not receiving supplementation; (c) not including any ergogenic aids classified
within  group  A  by  the  AIS  because  of  their  high  evidence  grade  [17];  (d)  not  taking
supplementation as a source of nutrients, such as bars, gels or drinks rich in carbohydrates,
proteins and electrolytes; (e) not presenting medical supplementation to prevent or treat
clinical issues; and (f) not grey literature (abstracts, conference proceedings or editorials)
or reviews.
2.4. Quality Assessment and Publication Bias
Evaluation was carried out by two reviewers (N.V.S. and A.M.R.) working indepen-
dently in order to assess risk of bias comprehensively. The characteristics of the retrieved
RCTs were evaluated using the PEDro scale ‘risk-of-bias’ assessment tool [18]. The follow-
ing bias criteria were considered: eligibility criteria, randomisation, allocation, baseline,
blinding of subjects and researchers, measures of one key outcome from >85% of the al-
located subjects, data from placebo and experimental groups and statistical comparisons,
including variability of measurements. Disagreements were resolved by consensus involv-
ing a third reviewer (E.F.M.) following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [19].

## 2.5. Statistical Analysis
A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of caffeine supplementation on
blood lactate, using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration,
Oxford, UK). The authors used a Microsoft Excel template to collect the relevant infor-
mation regarding the studies that included caffeine supplementation and blood lactate
measurements. The template included the following variables: study authors and year of
publication, sports discipline, group, caffeine dose and pre- and post-combat or test blood
lactate data.
The effect of caffeine supplementation was determined by calculating the difference in
the blood lactate before and after combat or a test. The blood lactate difference was subjected
to inverse-variance weighting [20]. In addition, because not all the sports disciplines are the
same, they do not use the same kind of combat. Hence, the standardised mean difference
(SMD) was used and combined with a random effects model [21].  The 95% confidence
interval (CI) was determined to evaluate the size of the changes.

tively. The Egger test was used to assess the publication bias by estimating the funnel plot
asymmetry [22]. Statistical significance was set asp< 0.05.
## 3. Results
## 3.1. Included Studies
A total of 547 studies were screened by title and abstract and 439 were assessed for
the eligibility criteria (full-text screening). From the retrieved articles, 55 met all inclusion
criteria and were included in the systematic review (Figure 1). Of these 55 studies, 45 were
found in Medline (two articles were not available despite requesting them from the cor-
responding author), seven were found in Scopus and three were retrieved from EBSCO
(Sportdiscus) (Table 2). The PRISMA flowchart illustrating the step-by-step exclusion of un-
related/duplicate records, leading to the final selection of 55 RCTs that met the predefined
inclusion criteria, is shown in Figure 1.

## 3.3. Participants
The participants in the examined studies ranged from 16.1 to 29.9 years old, meaning that
they included junior to senior athletes. The level ranged from amateur to professional in both
sexes, with a majority of male athletes (n= 726) compared with female athletes (n= 78) and non-
determined gender because the studies did not report it(n= 150) [27,34,37,45,57,58,63–65,69].
Most studies focussed on grappling disciplines(n= 33) [42–74], followed by striking disci-
plines (n= 15) [23–41], mixed disciplines(n= 1) [75]and combat sports in general since
they were not identified in the methodology (n= 2) [76,77]. In the case of NEAs, caffeine
was the most evaluated supplement (n= 26) [23–30,42–58], followed by plasma buffers
(n= 19)[31–34,59–65,76], nitric oxide (NO) precursors (n= 8) [39–41,70–73,77], creatine
(n= 4) [31,38,68,69] and hydration agents (n= 1) [74].
3.4. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids and Intervention Characteristics in Striking Combat Sports
Caffeine was the most tested NEA with eight studies (Table 2). All trials had a duration
of 1 day with variations in concentrations and timing. Most studies used a caffeine dose of
5–6 mg/kg 30–60 min before the tests [24,26–30], with improvements in specific combat
skills such as the effort–pause ratio and time of punching sequences during a simulated
boxing combat and a greater number of attacks (+5–15% successful kicks or +27% in the
number of attacks compared with the placebo group [25,30]) and less reaction and skipping
time in simulated taekwondo combats compared with the placebo groups. General skills
such as power (+2.3–6.8%), jump height (+5.1% [26]), time to exhaustion (TTE; +5.6% [27]),
blood lactate (+20.0–26.2% [26,29,30]) and glycolytic energy contribution (+24.8–67.2% [29])
were higher than the placebo groups, while fatigue perception was lower (−61.5% [24]).
Only one study used a lower caffeine dose (3 mg/kg 60 min before the test) and found an
improvement in the number of kicks and the specific taekwondo agility test but without
changes in fatigue perception [23]. Other protocols with mouth rinsing with 6 mg/kg of
caffeine just before the tests in taekwondo athletes showed an increase in the percentage
of successful kicks and less perceptual training intensity during a specific taekwondo test
compared with the placebo group during a Ramadan period [25].

Nutrients2022,14, 258821 of 32
NEAs related to plasma buffer function have been evaluated by three 1-day and
two3–5-daystudies.  A load of 0.3 g/kg of sodium bicarbonate taken for 3 days before
the test and intake of 0.1 g/kg 120, 90 and 30 min before a karate-specific test produced
improvements in TTE (+8.9%), but maintenance of vertical jumps, blood lactate and heart
rate compared with the placebo group [27]. In addition, for a higher sodium bicarbonate
dose taken for 5 days (4×0.125 g/kg/day≈0.5 g/kg/day), there were improvements
in power (+18.4%) in a specific taekwondo test accompanied by a significant decrease in
lactate after the test [31].  For the 1-day protocol, 0.3 g/kg of sodium bicarbonate taken
60–90 min before the test increased TTE (+55.5%), blood lactate (+39.5%), pH (+1.4%),
glycolytic energy contribution, attack time and punch efficacy, with different results on the
heart rate [32,33].
There  has  been  only  one  study  that  combined  caffeine  with  sodium  bicarbonate
regarding striking combat sports [27]. During a 3-day protocol, karate athletes ingested
0.3 g/kg/day of sodium bicarbonate. On the test day, they consumed 6 mg/kg of caffeine
60 min before and 0.1 g/kg of caffeine 120, 90 and 60 min before the test.  The authors
reported only a higher TTE (+9.3%) relative to the placebo group, while the highest vertical
jump, blood lactate and heart rate were not different compared with the placebo group.
Both NEAs consumed together did not show any advantage compared when they were
consumed separately [27].
Beta-alanine, which has a role as an intracellular buffer precursor, has been used
in three studies examining striking combat sports [35–37].  All the studies used boxers
as volunteers.   One study  lasted 10 weeks  with a  dose of 4.9–5.4  g/day and showed
improvements in general fitness (as peak power in lower limbs and less power drop in
upper limbs, but not in strength or blood lactate levels) [36]. The other two studies, which
lasted 4 weeks using 6 g/day or 0.3 g/kg/day of beta-alanine, observed mixed results in
blood lactate levels compared with the placebo group [35,37]. Furthermore, the authors
showed improvements using beta-alanine in specific combat skills, namely a higher number
and force of punches, but only as a time×group interaction [37], and there were no changes
in power or the fatigue index [35].
Two studies evaluated the efficacy of creatine monohydrate in taekwondo practitioners.
A dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks did not offer advantages compared with the placebo
group regarding power or fatigue perception. It only produced a significant increase in
blood triglycerides [38]. On the other hand, a higher dose over less time (4×5 g/day for
5 days) offered improvements in power (+17.3%) after a specific taekwondo test without
affecting lactate levels [31].
Only one study has examined the combination of creatine and sodium bicarbonate,
specifically in striking combat sports [31]. During a 5-day protocol, taekwondo athletes
ingested 0.5 g/kg/day of sodium bicarbonate and 4×5 g/day of creatine. Compared with
the placebo group, peak (+28.3%) and mean (+39.2%) power were significantly higher and
blood lactate levels were lower after a specific test. Both NEAs consumed together showed
advantages in mean power compared with when they were consumed separately [31].
There are studies that have examined NO precursors. Intake of 2 g/kg beetroot juice
150 min before the test in boxers did not produced differences in blood lactate levels or heart
rate compared with the placebo group, but there was a significant decrease in power [41].

3.5. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids and Intervention Characteristics in Grappling Combat Sports
For striking combat sports, caffeine has been the most tested NEA in the grappling
modality with 17 studies, with judo being the most evaluated discipline (Table 2).  Caf-

feine has been tested in judoists 60 min before the exercise protocol with a dose ranging
from 3 to 9 mg/kg [43,45,47,49–52,54,56,58].  Specific skills including the number of to-
talthrows [47,49,52,54,56], total attacks [49–51], the special fitness judo test (SFJT) index
(expressed as heart rate divided by total throws) [52,56] and handgripstrength [43,45,51]
showed mixed results regardless of the dose used. General skills or physiological responses
such as heart rate [45,47,49,52,56], and fatigue or effortperception [45,47,49,50,52,54,56,58]also
produced mixed results, while only blood lactate levels (+14.8–54.1% [47,51,54,56]) increased
with a dose ranging from 5 to 6 mg/kg compared with the placebogroups [47,51,54,56].
Height or power of jumps did not change compared with the placebo group [51], but the
reaction time and power showed significant improvements [58]. Velocity in the execution
of some resistance exercises also was improved with the consumption of 3–6 mg/kg of
caffeine [43].  Other grappling disciplines such as wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu used
similar caffeine protocols with doses ranging from 3 to 10 mg/kg 30–60 min before the
tests [42,44,45,48,53,55,57]. In the case of combat skills, time to complete a specific wrestling
test [48], the number of attacks but not defensive actions [55] and handgrip strength [45,55]
were improved with 3–6 mg/kg of caffeine compared with the placebo group. Focussing
on general physical aptitudes, wrestlers showed less improvement in jump height with
a dose of 4–10 mg/kg of caffeine than Brazilian jiu-jitsu athletes, with better results in
static lifts and weight, power and velocity in 1RM (increasing the repetitions in bench
press compared with the placebo) taking 3 mg/kg of caffeine [42,44,48,53,55]. There were
inconsistent changes in heart rate regardless of the caffeine dose [42,45,48,57], a trend to
increase blood lactate for doss ranged from 3 to 6.2 mg/kg [48,55,57] and no changes in
hydration status (based on urine osmolality and specific gravity) for doss < 10 mg/kg [48].
Lastly, in the case of effort perception, 5.2–6 mg/kg caffeine was optimal [48,53,55,57]. The
use of caffeinated chewing gums (2.7–5.4 mg/kg of caffeine) by judoists 15 min before
a test did not improve specific combat skills (total throws or the SFJT index) or general
physiological aspects (blood lactate, heart rate or perceptual training intensity [46].
Different plasma buffers have also been evaluated, including sodium bicarbonate
and  sodium  citrate  [54,59–65].   A  load  of  0.5  g/kg  of  sodium  bicarbonate  offered  for
7  days  [62]  or  an  increasing  dose  ranging  from  0.025  to  0.1  g/kg  g/kg  provided  for
10 days [60,61] produced a dose–response relationship in terms of improvements in power
(+13.7–16.0% [62,63])and total work (+8.0% [62]), but mixed results in terms of blood lactate
levels. Even with a high dose there were no improvements in effort or fatigue perception
compared with the placebo group [62]. Acute doses of sodium bicarbonate (0.1–0.3 g/kg)
60–120 min before tests improved specific skills such as throws (+4.9–5.1% [54,63]) in ju-
doists in a dose–response manner [54,63] but not handgrip strength in jiu-jitsu athletes [59].
This dosing regimen produced higher power (+16.0% [63]) and significantly increased
blood lactate levels (+17.8–26.3%) after specific judo tests [54,63] but not after anaerobic
general tests (Wingate test) or handgrip and forearm strength contraction tests [59,63]. Simi-
larly to long protocols with sodium bicarbonate, there were no changes in effort and fatigue
perception with acute doses [54,63].  Sodium citrate has been evaluated in two studies
using 0.6–0.9 g/kg 16 h, 8 h and 30–120 min before upper-body intermittent sprint per-
formance tests in wrestlers and Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners [64,65]. Although the dose
range elevated blood pH and improved water intake retention and plasma volume, only
0.9 g/kg of sodium citrate increased blood lactate levels (+15.0%) [64]. Power; heart rate;
fatigue perception; and urine volume, osmolality and specific gravity were not significantly
different compared with the placebo group.
Only one study used a combination of caffeine with sodium bicarbonate in judoists [54].
Participants ingested for 1 day 6 mg/kg of caffeine 60 min before the test with 0.1 g/kg of
sodium bicarbonate 60, 90 and 120 min before a specific performance judo test. The number
of throws was higher (+7.8% [54]) than the placebo group—and even compared with
caffeine or sodium bicarbonate consumed separately—and the blood lactate levels were
elevated (+21.9% [54]), while there were no significant differences in perceptual training
intensity [54].

Beta-alanine, an intracellular buffer precursor, has been evaluated in three studies
focussing on grappling combat sports [62,66,67]. A dose of 4.4 g/day for 8 weeks in amateur
wrestlers did not improve general test performance (running time, flexed arm hang time or
blood lactate levels) [67]. On the other hand, when the dose was increased to 6.4 g/day for
4 weeks, judoists and jiu-jitsu practitioners showed a higher number of throws (+9.0% [66]),
higher total work (+7.0% [62]) and greater mean power (+6.5–10.5% [62]) (but not peak)
but no changes in blood pH and perceptual effort [62,66].
To assess the possible synergistic effect with the combination of intramuscular and
plasma buffers, judoists and jiu-jitsu volunteers followed a 4-week beta-alanine protocol
using 6.4 mg/day with a 7-day sodium bicarbonate protocol (0.5 g/kg) [62]. In the general
Wingate anaerobic test, the mean power (+8.6–20.3%) and peak power (+15.3–22.3%) were
higher than the placebo group and during more bouts than sodium bicarbonate or beta-
alanine consumed separately. Moreover, total work was even higher that the consumption
of beta-alanine or sodium bicarbonate alone. Blood lactate was significantly higher than
the placebo group and the perceptual training intensity was lower (taking these NEAs
separately did not affect this parameter) [62].
The effect of creatine has been evaluated in two studies in amateur wrestlers and
Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners, one of them with a load of 0.3 g/kg/day for 5 days [68],
and the other for 15 days [69]. There were improvements relative to the control group in
handgrip strength and agility [69] but no significant changes in peak and mean power,
blood lactate levels, heart rate, fatigue perception or urine specific gravity [68].
Four studies have evaluated NO precursors:  one of them using beetroot juice [70],
another using a beetroot-based gel [71] and the other two examining different arginine
protocols [72,73]. Ingestion of 600 mg of NO

Intake of 12.2 mmol of NO

contained in a beetroot-based gel by amateur Brazilian jiu-
jitsu volunteers for 8 days resulted in a significant increase in maximal voluntary forearm
contraction and muscle oxygen saturation during a forearm isometric test, and a significant
decrease in blood lactate (−29.3%) after exercise [71].  Long protocols with 6 g/day of
arginine for 3 days in judoists only increased blood arginine levels without affecting power
and blood lactate after an intermittent anaerobic test [73].  In the case of acute protocols
using 150 mg/kg of arginine 60 min before a cycloergometer test in wrestlers, there was
only an improvement in TTE (+5.8% [72]) and no changes in blood lactate, heart rate or

Lastly, among hydration agents only glycerol has been examined [74]. Consumption
of 1 g/kg glycerol 60 min before the Wingate test by wrestlers did not alter anaerobic power,
body mass, urine specific gravity and saliva osmolality.
3.6. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids and Intervention Characteristics in Other Combat Sports
Caffeine as an NEA to improve punching has been examined in MMA (Table 2) [75].
Consuming 5 mg/kg of caffeine 60 min before the test did not alter punch frequency, punch
force or perceptual training intensity compared with the placebo group.
A long protocol with 10 g/day of sodium bicarbonate (21 days) before the Wingate test
in non-specified combat sports increased total work (+10.9%) and peak (+10.7%) and mean
(+11.4%) power only in the upper limbs [76].  Blood lactate levels were higher (+13.7%)
than the placebo group while other biochemical parameters such as insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1) and cortisol increased and decreased, respectively.
In a study in which the authors did not specify the combat disciplines, participants
were given a beetroot-based gel containing 12.2 mmol of NO

## 4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of Caffeine in Combat Sports
Caffeine  exerts  its  role  as  an  agonist  of  adenosine  A1  and  A2a  receptors  [78],
modulating central nervous system activity by inhibiting parasympathetic activity. At the
metabolic  level,  caffeine  leads  to  elevated  blood  norepinephrine  levels,  enhancing
glycolytic  activity  to  increase  muscle  energy  supply  during  high-intensity  exercise
[79,80,81].  Caffeine  is  an  effective  ergogenic  aid  for  aerobic  and  anaerobic  exercise,
providing improvements in performance and the perceptions of exertion and muscle pain
with doses ranging from 2.35 to 5 mg/kg [82,83]. Coffee and derivates are habitual drinks
in many cultures around the world, so it is common for athletes to consume caffeine from
these sources. It does not seem that habitual caffeine consumption affects the ergogenic
effects of caffeine [84].
Combat sports involve a multitude of muscle groups and high-intensity intermittent
actions,  due  to  the  large  number  of  attacks  with  great  force  and  speed  that  utilise  the
energy provided from the anaerobic metabolic pathway. Although studies indicate that

## 4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of Caffeine in Combat Sports
Caffeine exerts its role as an agonist of adenosine A1 and A2a receptors [78], modulat-
ing central nervous system activity by inhibiting parasympathetic activity. At the metabolic
level, caffeine leads to elevated blood norepinephrine levels, enhancing glycolytic activity
to increase muscle energy supply during high-intensity exercise [79–81].  Caffeine is an
effective ergogenic aid for aerobic and anaerobic exercise, providing improvements in
performance and the perceptions of exertion and muscle pain with doses ranging from
2.35 to 5 mg/kg [82,83]. Coffee and derivates are habitual drinks in many cultures around
the world, so it is common for athletes to consume caffeine from these sources. It does not
seem that habitual caffeine consumption affects the ergogenic effects of caffeine [84].
Combat sports involve a multitude of muscle groups and high-intensity intermittent
actions, due to the large number of attacks with great force and speed that utilise the energy
provided from the anaerobic metabolic pathway. Although studies indicate that the aerobic
energy pathway is the main one and contributes to the recovery process during breaks
between rounds, the decisive actions are maintained by anaerobic processes [85–90].  In
combat sports, most studies have analysed caffeine doses from 5 to 10 mg/kg and have re-
ported improvements in various aspects of performance. In both specific and general skills,
the improvements are based mainly on abilities related to glycolytic metabolism: the effort–
pause ratio, the time of punching sequences, the number of attacks, reaction and skipping
time, handgrip strength, power, static lifts and TTE, among others [24–28,30,49,52,58]. More

studies that evaluate the combination of caffeine and sodium bicarbonate are necessary to
verify a clear synergistic response, because the available results are heterogenous [27,54]
as well as compared to the conclusion reached in other studies [91].  In this regard, ath-
letes are able to reach higher intensity levels due to a greater production and tolerance
of blood lactate levels (2.1–20.9 vs. 3.2–18.9 mmol/L in the caffeine and placebo groups,
respectively) through the use of the glycolytic pathways for energy production (Figure 2).
These findings are similar to results observed in disciplines where glycolytic metabolism is
involved [92–94].
The results that caffeine consumption increased blood lactate levels compared with
the placebo group are consistent with the results of a recent review [95].  Although this
review explained that caffeine increases the blood lactate concentration, it is necessary
to consider that caffeine ingestion is used to enhance an athlete’s physical performance,
and it could allow them to produce more intense efforts for a longer time. This sustained
effort could lead to higher blood lactate levels.   On the other hand,  the perception of
effort was improved when using a range of 4–10 (5×2) mg/kg of caffeine in only five
studies [24,25,42,48,52],  with a fair score on the PEDro scale for one of them [25].   In
12 studies that provided the participants with 3–9 mg/kg caffeine, there was no difference
compared with the placebo group, or even an increased feeling of fatigue coinciding with
the lowestdoses [27–30,49,50,53–55,57,58,75].  These findings are consistent with results
in other disciplines [96]. In 1- and 3-day protocols with caffeine and sodium bicarbonate,
caffeine did not improve perceived exertion [27,54]. Additional studies are necessary with
higher doses of caffeine to determine whether there is a strong effect in the effort perception
during high-intensity tasks.
4.2. Effects of Buffering Supplements in Combat Sports
Bicarbonate coming from carbon dioxide (CO
## 2
) acts as the main mechanism to buffer
plasma acidification.  Normally, a drop in muscle and plasma pH occurs during high-
intensity exercise, because acid (H
## +
) and CO
## 2
tend to accumulate [97]. The efficacy of acute
sodium bicarbonate supplementation is influenced by the duration of exercise. Specifically,
sports of prolonged duration (>4 min) have shown mixed results with the use of sodium
bicarbonate supplementation, improving performance in running and cycling, but not in
rowing, rugby, water polo or basketball [97].  Because sodium bicarbonate could cause
gastrointestinal discomfort [98], other buffer supplements such as sodium citrate have been
tested.  On the other hand, beta-alanine acts as intracellular buffer, increasing carnosine
content and, subsequently, improving high-intensity exercise capacity in cycling [99]. A
meta-analysis revealed improved high-intensity endurance performance from 30 s to 10 min
in duration [100].
An acute dose of 0.3 g/kg of sodium bicarbonate for 1 or 3 days improved the number
of throws, power and TTE in combat sports [27,32–34,63]. This finding is similar to studies
with racquet sports, where specific skills and TTE tended to improve [94].  On the other
hand, the same protocol could not improve handgrip strength and total forearm contrac-
tions [59]. Lower doses had little to no effect on the number of throws (until 0.1 g/kg) [54]
and the power (in a protocol of progressive dose increase from 0.025 g/kg to 0.1 g/kg over
10 days) [60,61]. Despite improvements in punch efficacy, attack time and total work used
for sports [27,32–34], additional studies are needed with more participants and a more
extensive dose range to verify this fact.  Regarding physiological aspects, there was an
increase in blood lactate, without affecting heart rate or fatigue perception, using high
doses (0.3 and 0.5 g/kg 60–90 min but not 120 min before the exercise or 10 g/day for
1 week) in different protocols [32,33,62,63,76] but mixed results were obtained with lower
doses [54,60,61]. An exception was the decrease in blood lactate after a taekwondo-specific
test with 0.5 g/kg/day of sodium bicarbonate for 5 days with or without creatine [31]. The
significant increase in blood lactate levels compared with the placebo group could be due
to carboxylate co-transporter, which extracts lactate and H

from working muscle cells
to the circulation after an increase in extracellular pH [101] and an increase in glycolytic

activity. It seems that only doses≥0.3 g/kg sodium bicarbonate produced an increase in
pH and glycolytic energy contribution, but more studies using a wide range of doses are
necessary to determine the optimal dose and to standardise exercise protocols.
Protocols using sodium citrate showed similar results regarding blood lactate (but
only with one study using 0.9 g/kg for one day [64]) and pH increase (with a 1-day protocol
providing 0.6–0.9 g/kg [64,65]).  These results are similar to those observed with lower
doses (0.5 g/kg) in intermittent sports such as tennis [92] and in swimmers using 0.3 g/kg
in a 400 m time-trial test [93]. While in tennis, but not in swimming, some specific skills
were improved, in combat sports they were not tested [64,65,92,93].  Sodium citrate has
also demonstrated improvements in water intake retention and plasma volume (without
affecting dehydration parameters measured in urine) [65], perhaps due to its influence
on hormone diuresis control [102]. Similar to sodium bicarbonate, there were no changes
compared with the placebo group in terms of heart rate or fatigue perception.
Intracellular buffering using 4.9–6.4 g/day of beta-alanine for 4–10 weeks in combat
sports improved power in general physical tests for both striking and grappling disci-
plines  [36,62].   On  the  other  hand,  strength,  total  work  or  running  time  showed  less
evidence of benefits [35,36,62,67].  Specific combat skills, such as punch efficacy and the
number of throws, tended to improve with beta-alanine supplementation (6.0–6.4 g/day
for 4 weeks) [37,66]. However, more studies are necessary to obtain stronger evidence, be-
cause other athletes such as climbers—who perform a large amount of isometric work with
forearm muscles, similar to grappling fighters—showed improvements in repeated high-
intensity intermittent upper body performance with lower doss (4 g/d during 4 weeks) [103].
Regarding physiological improvements with beta-alanine supplementation, mixed results
have been obtained regarding blood lactate levels [36,37,62,66,67]. There were no changes
in blood pH [66] or fatigue perception when beta-alanine was used alone—but fatigue
perception was enhanced when used together with sodium bicarbonate [62].
Buffering supplements appear to have greater benefits in grappling disciplines, but
additional investigation is necessary with the aim of achieving strong evidence regarding
the optimal dose range that positively affects specific combat skills, as well as its possible
synergistic effects with the combination of several of them and other NEAs (i.e., caffeine).
4.3. Effects of Creatine Monohydrate in Combat Sports
Creatine  monohydrate  supplementation  has  been  used  as  a  strategy  to  increase
strength and muscle mass during training, but it has also been reported to improve power
and anaerobic capacity [104–106]. Thus, the use of creatine in combat sports such as judo is
of great interest because about 10% of elite Japanese and Korean judoists take it [107].
The use of high doses of creatine (0.3 g/kg/day or 20 g/day) for 5–15 days improved
performance (agility and power) [31,69] and combat skills in grappling disciplines (hand-
grip strength) [69], but the study obtained a fair score for the PEDro scale. The results are in
the line with other intermittent disciplines such as racquet sports, where only 0.3  g/kg for
5 days improved sprint time in squash players [94]. Additional studies with specific-combat
tests, better-quality experimental design (similar baseline sample inclusion criteria and
blinding subjects, therapists and assessors regarding the treatments) and greater homo-
geneity in the protocols are necessary to confirm this fact with a wide range of doses and in
striking disciplines. At present, there is no evidence for its recommendation.
4.4. Effects of Nitric Oxide Precursors in Combat Sports
NO  has  a  relevant  role  as  an  intracellular  second  messenger  and  its  production
is also related to an increase in blood flow, which improves nutrient and hormone de-
livery.   Furthermore,  NO  has  a  positive  impact  on  resistance  and  endurance  training
adaptions [108,109].  Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses about NO synthase–
independent pathway supplementation have shown that sodium nitrate and potassium
nitrate are less effective than beetroot juice consumption in endurance exercise. The use
of 6–12 mmol of NO
## 3
## −

Nutrients2022,14, 258827 of 32
provements in time to exhaustion in a 5–30 min cycling race, but slightly non-significant
improvements in time trial or graded-exercise performance [80]. Regarding combat sports,
neither 2 g/kg of beetroot juice [41] nor 400 and 800 mg of NO
## 3
## −
contained in the juice [39]
produced performance advantages; indeed, there were negative effects on power compared
with the placebo group [41].  Misinformation regarding the NO
## 3
## −
concentration of the
product [41] did not permit determining whether the ergogenic dose established in other
sports trials was achieved.  On the other hand, beetroot-based gel supplementation for
8 days or 120 min before exercise increased maximal voluntary forearm contraction and
muscle oxygen saturation and decreased blood lactate levels after exercise (improvements
in lactate clearance) compared with the placebo group in an isometric test exercise [71,77].
In this case, the NO
## 3
## −
concentration was 12.2 mmol, near the upper end of the range
established for other studies with improvements in performance [110,111]. Beetroot extract

peak
and the anaerobic threshold without affecting blood lactate levels [40]. More studies are
necessary using beetroot-based products and well-established nitrate-containing beetroot
juices in specific combat tests before providing adequate advice for combat sports.
In  the  case  of  NO  synthase–dependent  pathway,  supplementing  l-arginine  as  its
natural precursor is not classified as a group A aid by the AIS, but recent publications
have shown interesting data that could support its use [112]. Anaerobic performance, the
main pathway to obtain energy during high-intensity actions in combat sports, is enhanced
by acute (0.15 g/kg of l-arginine 60–90 min before exercise) and chronic (10–12 g/day for
8 weeks) use [112].  Only an acute protocol with 150 mg/kg of l-arginine 60 min before
exercise enhanced TTE in wrestlers [72], according to meta-analyses results [112], but the
study obtained a fair score on the PEDro scale.  A chronic protocol with a lower dose
(6 g/day of l-arginine) than the range established as ergogenic and taken for less time
(3 days) had no effects in judoists [73].  In this sense, it is too early to establish a robust
recommendation regarding l-arginine supplementation.
4.5. Effects of Glycerol Supplementation in Combat Sports
Glycerol is a metabolite that acts as a plasma expander and could help athletes main-
tain euhydration and improve thermoregulatory and cardiovascular changes [9]. Until 2018,
WADA had considered glycerol a banned substance because it was believed that it could
alter an athlete’s biological passport [113]. In any case, the results of its supplementation
are mixed, both in endurance and anaerobic disciplines [8].  In combat sports, 1.0 g/kg
glycerol before the Wingate test in wrestlers could not improve anaerobic power and did
not affect body mass, urine specific gravity or saliva osmolality [74].  More research is
needed to determine glycerol’s supposed potential efficacy in combat sports in specific
tests and in more disciplines.
## 5. Conclusions
Caffeine is the NEA for which there is clear evidence of benefits for combat sports
practitioners. Acute doses (5–10 mg/kg) 30–60 min before combat may improve specific
skills that rely on glycolytic metabolism to obtain energy, but it may not contribute to
improve perceived exertion.   Even though some evidence concludes that other NEAs
show promise in improving performance, such as buffering supplements, more studies
are necessary, specifically for grappling disciplines, to verify its validity during sustained
isometric efforts.  Creatine, NO precursors or glycerol could play an interesting role in
improving performance, but more studies are needed to strengthen the evidence.
