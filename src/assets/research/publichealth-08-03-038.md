Abstract: Nutrition  is  the  aspect  closely  connected  to  physical  activity  and  may  affect  body
composition,  sports  performance  and post-workout  regeneration.  Using  an  appropriate  diet  plan  is  a
proven  method  to  optimize  performance  improvements  in  combat  sports.  In  the  majority  of  combat
sports  athletes  are  classified  according  to  their  body  mass  in  order  to  minimize  differences  between
competitors. Many athletes induce weight loss in order to gain an advantage over their opponents. The
review was undertaken to provide safe, evidence-based protocols helping athletes in weight reduction
without negative effects on sports performance. The nutritional requirements for combat sports athletes,
sports supplements, gradual and rapid weight reduction strategies are discussed in this review.

## 1. Introduction
Combat sport is a term used to describe a competitive contact sport where two combatants fight
against each other using a particular contest’s rules [1]. The most popular combat sports include
wrestling,  judo,  kickboxing,  mixed  martial  arts,  boxing,  karate  and  taekwondo. In  the  majority  of
combat  sports, athletes are  classified according to their  body mass  in  order to  minimize differences
between  competitors  including  body  size,  strength  and  agility  [2].  Most  combat  sports  may  be
classified as intermittent, high-intensity sports [3].
There are many methods that have proved to optimize performance improvements including an
appropriate  diet  plan  or  using  sports  supplements.  Nutrition  as  the  aspect  closely  connected  to

physical  activity  may  affect  body  composition,  sports  performance  and  post-workout  regeneration.
The  nutritional  requirements  for  athletes  are  higher  than  for  the  average  population  for  many
nutrients.  In combat  sports  the  recommended  nutrition  and energy intake may  further  exceed levels
for non-training population [4].
- Energy and carbohydrates
The  primary  component  to  optimize  sports  performance  in  combat  sports  is  ensuring  an
adequate energy intake. The caloric needs for athletes training with moderate or high intensity may
approach 40–70 kcals/kg/day depending on the intensity and frequency of trainings. For elite athletes
the recommended energy intake may further exceed these levels [5]. It has to be mentioned that the
fundamental  factor  of  sports  nutrition  is  nutrient  timing  and  it  refers  to  the  time  when the  body  is
able  to  use  macronutrients  most  effectively  [6].  The  timing  of  energy  intake  may  enhance  muscle
protein synthesis, recovery and tissue repair [5].
The primary source of energy for athletes are carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, as energy substrates,
can be oxidized via aerobic metabolism (for instance by glycolytic pathway coupled with Krebs cycle
and  electron  transport  chain)  or  converted  into  lactate  via  anaerobic  metabolism  such  as  anaerobic
glycolysis. As a result, adenosine triphosphate is synthesized and the energy is transferred. The ability to
maintain  exercise  is  connected  with  muscle  glycogen  content  [3].  It  has  been  proved  that  the  proper
level  of  carbohydrates  in  a  diet  is  connected  with  a  higher  strength  and  muscle  glycogen  storage  [7].
Glycogen is a fuel source of glucose, stored in the cytosol of cells. Skeletal muscle cells involve 1–2%
of glycogen and liver cells include 5–6% of glycogen respectively. Glycogen stores in muscles and the
liver  decrease  during  physical  activity.  The  prolongation  and  intensification  of  the  activity  leads  to  an
overall reduction of glycogen stores [8]. The recommended intake of carbohydrates in an athletes’ diet is
related  to  the  type  and  intensity  of  trainings  and  should  vary  between  4–5  g/kg  to  8–10  g/kg of body
mass.  High  intensity,  endurance  sports  are  related  to  greater  carbohydrate  intake  [9,5].  Combat  sports
include  aerobic  and  anaerobic  metabolism  during  effort  and  can  deplete  glycogen  storage  during
training [10]. In high intensity sports, such as combat sports, the intake of carbohydrates may gain 10–
12 g/kg of body mass daily [3]. Carbohydrate is the most important macronutrient in pre-exercise meal.
It  has  been  proved  that  ingesting  carbohydrates  before  training  improves  endurance  and  increases
muscle and liver glycogen [11,12]. One of the studies has shown that athletes consuming meals 3 hours
before training had higher endurance than people training in the fasted state [13]. In another study, the
authors  investigated  that  consumption  of  a  high-carbohydrate  meal  4  hours  before  cycling  exercise  at
70%  maximum  oxygen  intake  (VO2  max)  significantly  increased  muscle  and  liver  glycogen.  The
exercise  was  taken  after  an  overnight  fast  and  lasted  105  minutes.  The  result  of  the  meal  consumed
before exercise was an increased rate of carbohydrate oxidation and utilization of muscle glycogen [14].
It has to be pointed out that there are several types of carbohydrates which are metabolized differently
by  the  body.  Differences  between  simple  and  complex  carbohydrates  are  related  to  their  ability  to  be
absorbed and used as a source of quick or more gradual energy [4]. It has been proved that the intake of
low  glycemic  index  of  carbohydrates  can  increase  the  durability  of  training  in  comparison  to  high
glycemic  index products  [15].  However,  the  type,  intensity  and  the  length  of  time  between  trainings
sessions seems to play a critical role. The athletes who train more than once a day with high intensity
should choose carbohydrates with high glycemic index in order to accelerate muscle glycogen synthesis
before the second training session [9]. The consumption of carbohydrate is crucial after exercise because

## 487
AIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485–498.
it  enhances  the  recovery  process  and  restoration  of  the  glycogen  depleted  during  training  [3].  High-
glycemic  products  may  restore  muscle  and  liver  glycogen  stores  more  quickly  in  comparision  to
complex  carbohydrates  [8].  One  type  of  substances  used  to  improve  performance  during  training  is
maltodextrins.   Maltodextrins   are   saccharide   polymers   consisting   of   D-glucose   [16].   They   are
hydrolyzed to free glucose molecules in the the small intestine and due to the low osmolality, they are
commonly  used  as  an  ingredient  of  sports  drinks  [17].  Consuming  30–60  g  of  high-glycemic  index
carbohydrates  during  an  exercise  lasting  more than  one  hour  maintains  high  rates  of  carbohydrates,
prevents hypoglycemia and can result in performance benefit [3,18,19]. It has been scientifically proven
that   beverages   containing   more   than   one   source   of   transportable   carbohydrates   (for   example
maltodextrins  and  fructose)  stimulate  greater  carbohydrates  absorption  due  to  additional  transport
mechanisms.  The  study  by  Wallis  et  al.  [16]  has  shown  that  in  ingestion  maltodextrin  and  fructose
during cycling exercise is related with higher oxidation rates than from ingesting maltodextrin alone.
## 3. Protein
The important macronutrient in combat sports is protein. The recommended intake in an athlete’s
diet is higher in comparison to non-training people in order to ensure regular muscle protein synthesis.
Muscle mass  loss  can  have  a  negative  effect  on  strength,  power  and  performance  [20].  The  current
protein recommendations for athletes is to gain 1.2–2 g/kg of body mass [21]. It has been proved that
the  requirements  for  athletes  who  are  reducing  weight  can  be higher  and  the  recommended  level  of
protein intake can gain 1.8–2.7 g/kg of body mass in order to prevent muscle mass loss during energy
deficiency. Consumption of an appropriate amount of essential amino acids, particularly leucine, leads
to muscle mass synthesis [22]. Essential amino acids cannot be synthetized de novo by the organism
and must be supplied by the diet. Ingestion of essential amino acids in free form or as part of a protein
bolus of 20–40 g after the exercise is known to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and could increase
strength  and  improve  body  composition  by  increasing  lean  body  mass [23]. A  proven  effect  on
stimulating  muscle  protein  synthesis  consumed  after  an  exercise  session  refers  to,  for  instance,  milk:
whey,  casein,  and  soy  protein  [20,24].  Each  high-quality  protein  elicits  different  digestibility,
physiological  responses,  and  different  muscle  retention  [24].  Whey  and  soy  protein  have  rapid
digestion which leads to a large increase in the amount of amino acids in blood. On the opposite side,
casein  precipitates  and  coagulates  in  stomach  acid  and  the  absorption  and  digestion  is  lower  [3].
Furthermore, whey and milk protein (containing both whey and casein) are able to stimulate superior
muscle protein synthesis than soy or casein [25].
## 4. Fat
The  recommended  level  of  fat  in  athletes’  diet  is  25–30%  of  energy  intake  and  the  most
preferable  sources  of  fat  are  unsaturated  fatty  acids,  particularly  omega-3  polyunsaturated  fatty
acids [9,26]. Omega-3  PUFAS  are  known  to  reduce  oxidative  stress  and  inflammation,  lower  the
risk of cardiovascular disease, reduce muscle soreness and increase muscle protein synthesis [27].
The study by Smith et al. [20] has shown that 8-weeks omega-3 supplementation including 1.86 g
EPA  and  1.5  g  DHA/day  increased  muscle  protein  anabolic  response  to  hyperinsulinemia–
hyperaminoacidaemia in healthy young adults. Excessive consumption of trans and saturated fatty
acids is connected with health implications and should be reduced in dietary intake. The nutritional

requirements for fat should be mostly covered by vegetable oils, sea fish, nuts and seeds [9,26]. In
sports, the  energy  for  cellular functions  is  derived from metabolism  glycogen  or triglycerides. By
the oxidative energy system, the oxygen is utilized in mitochondria of cells resulting in production
of  ATP  [29].  During  light  and  moderate  exercises,  energy  needs  of  the  muscle  are  met  by
carbohydrates  and  free  fatty  acids  [26].  By  the  lipolysis,  triglycerides  stored  in  muscles  and
adipose sites are metabolized into glycerol and free fatty acids. The maximal  fat  oxidation  can  be
reached at approximately 47–52% of VO2 max in untrained individuals and 59–64% of VO2 max
in  endurance-trained  athletes  [29]. In contrast to carbohydrates, fats are known to have unlimited
availability. While increasing the duration of training, the carbohydrates stores are decreasing until
they are finally depleted [4].
## 5. Water
Water  is  a  crucial  ergogenic  aid  for  athletes  and  an  adequate  level  of  hydration  is  necessary  to
maintain  exercise  capacity  [30].  It  has  been  proved  that  2%  of  dehydration  can  impair  sports
performance.  Dehydration  of  4%  may  lead  to  serious  health  outcomes  such  as  heat  exhaustion,  heat
stroke or heat illness [5]. It has been proposed that dehydration used for weight loss increases the risk
of   acute   cardiovascular   problems   including   ischaemic   heart   disease   and   stroke.   Furthermore,
significant levels of dehydration may alter the brain morphology and increase the risk of brain injury
related  to  head  trauma  induced  by  strikes  [31].  The  physical  activity  induces  sweating  which  is  with
mineral  loss,  particularly  sodium,  potassium,  calcium  and  magnesium  [32].  The  duration  of  training,
heat  acclimatization,  weather  conditions  or  genetic  predisposition  influence  the  sweating level  and
determine fluid needs [33]. Recent studies have shown that the type of the training plays an important
role  in  fluid  loss.  In  the  study  by Rivera-Brown  et  al.  [34]  authors  indicated  that  sweat  loss  and  the
level  of  dehydration  during  training  in a tropical  climate  was  lower  in  intermittent  type  of  sport  in
comparision  to  continous  training.  The  appropriate  ratio  of  sodium  and  potassium  is  significant  for
maintaining adequate fluid balance or ensuring proper cardiovascular and nervous system function [32].
The  most  important  role  of  magnesium  and  calcium  in  the  context  of  sports  is  regulating  muscle
function, stabilizing enzymic reactions, regulating energy production and facilitating transport of other
nutrients  [35].  In  order  to  compensate  water  loss  induced  by  training,  athletes  should  consume
approximately 0.5–2 L/hour of water or glucose-electrolyte solutions during exercise. A good strategy
to monitor changes in fluid balance is weighing athletes before and after a training session in order to
provide  the  proper  level  of  hydration  and  increase  the  sports  performance  [5].  In  the  study  by
Stefanovsky  et  al. [36]  authors  have  shown  that  the  hydration  status  in  youth  judo  athletes  during  an
off-season  was  not  optimal.  The  similar  results  have  been  indicated  in  the  research  by  Petterson  and
Berg  [37]  where  89%  of  combat  sports  athletes  participating  in  the  study  were  hypohydrated  in  the
morning  of  the  competition  day.  An  effective  method  for  improving  short  duration  performance
following acute hypohydration may be passive heat- acclimation protocols [31].
## 6. Supplements
The  influence  on  strength,  endurance  and  body  composition  may  also  have  sports  supplements.
There are many substances which have a proven impact on the effectiveness of training [38,39]. Using
supplements may delay the onset of fatigue and allow an athlete to train in higher intensity [3]. According

AIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485–498.
to  the  Australian  Institute  of  Sports,  supplement  ingredients  are  ranked  into  4  groups  in  order  to
determine if the product is safe and effective at improving sports performance. Substances classificated in
group A are scientifically proven to support, and enhance sports performance and prevent or treat clinical
issues, for instance sports food, vitamin D, calcium, iron, caffeine or creatine. Substances ranked in group
B are based on emerging scientific support and deserving of further research. The substances that have
been classificated in group B are for example food polyphenols, fish oils, carnitine, vitamin C and E or
Branched-Chain Amino Acids. In group C the supplements are not supportive of benefit amongst athletes
and  substances  classified  in  the  group  D  are  banned  to  be  used  by  athletes  [40].  Substances  such  as
stimulants, prohormones and hormone boosters, GH releasers and peptides are on the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) list and shouldn’t be injected by athletes [41]. In combat sports, the benefits of using
supplements   may   be   provided   below   two   strategies- an   acute   supplementation   and   chronic
supplementation  strategy.  An  acute  supplementation  strategy  includes  the  consumption  of  supplements
which have the ability to optimize performance improvements when used in the minutes to hours before
training  or  competition.  A  chronic  supplementation  strategy  refers  to  the  consumption  of  sports
supplements that need to be used over a period including several days or weeks in order to enhance sports
performance [42].
One  of  the  substances  which  have  a  proven  ergogenic  effect  in  combat  sports  is  caffeine  [42].
Caffeine  has  been  ranked  in  list  A  of the  Australian  Institute  of  Sports  [40]  and  can  be  found  in
supplements or food products such as coffee, tea, chocolate or energy drinks [30]. Supplementation with
3–6 mg/kg of caffeine could increase the glycolytic contribution to energy metabolism. The ingestion of
caffeine may also improve levels of power, strength and upper arm muscular endurance [43]. The studies
have shown that 6 mg/kg of caffeine may decrease extracellular potassium concentration [44]. Ingesting
caffeine  60  minutes  before  training or competition  may  be  adequate  due  to  the  plasma  levels  peak  an
hour after consuming caffeine [42]. However, it must be noticed that there are some studies showing no
ergogenic effect of caffeine supplementation in combat sports [45,46].
Another ergogenic supplement with evidence-based influence on performance that may be used
in  combat  sports  is  sodium  bicarbonate.  Sodium  bicarbonate  is  an  alkalizing  agent  which  is  able  to
augment extracellular buffering capacity [42]. During high-intensity exercises, carbon dioxide (CO
## 2
## )
and hydrogen (H
## +
) cumulate in the blood and muscles. Through the bicarbonate system the body rids
itself  of  the  hydrogen  and  CO
## 2
via  their  conversion  to  bicarbonate  throughout  the  renal  and
respiratory system [5]. Sodium bicarbonate has been classified in group A in the list of the Australian
Institute  of  Sports  [40].  In  the  study  by  Artioli  et  al.  [47]  authors  have  demonstrated  that  the
ingestion  0.3  g/kg  of  sodium  bicarbonate  2  hours  before  exercise  improves  performance  in
specialized  judo-tests.  Similar  effects  were  shown  in  the  study  by  Lopes- Silva  et  al.  [48].
Supplementation 300 mg/kg body mass of NaHCO 90 minutes before the combat simulation induced
increased  lactate  concentration  and  total  time  attack  in taekwondo  athletes.  Furthermore,  greater
estimated glycolytic energy contribution in the first round was noticed when compared with placebo.
Similar  effects  may  be  achieved  with  a  chronic  supplementation  strategy.  One  of  the  studies  has
shown  that  ingestion  500  mg  of  sodium  bicarbonate/kg  of  body  mass  split  in  5  or  4  smaller  doses
improves  work  output  for  two  days  after  cessation  of  ingestion  [49].  Nevertheless,  it  has  to  be
noticed that supplementing sodium  bicarbonate can  cause gastrointestinal  distress including nausea,
diarrhoea, vomiting  and  stomach  pain  [46].  The  method  which  is  used  to  minimize  the  risk  of
gastrointestinal symptoms is by progressively increasing the doses of sodium bicarbonate. In a study
by  Durkalec-Michalski,  the  researchers  used  a  progressive  protocol  lasting 10  days  starting  with

## 490
AIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485–498.
0.025 g/kg of body mass on two days and increasing the dose until the last day to 0.1 g/kg of body
mass to ensure gastrointestinal distress [50].
The  ingestion  of  beta-alanine  could  also  be  beneficial  in  combat  sports.  It  has  been  proved  that
using  beta-alanine  supplements  increase  intramuscular  carnosine  levels.  Carnosine  is  a  dipeptide
prolifically found in skeletal muscle, composed of histidine and beta-alanine. Carnosine is believed to
exert  an  important  acid-base  regulation  function  [3].  After  ingestion,  carnosine  is  degraded  into
histidine and beta-alanine so that it doesn't increase skeletal muscle carnosine levels [42]. On the other
hand, β-alanine  supplementation  increases  intramuscular  carnosine  levels.  Supplementation  with  1.6–
6.4 g/day for at least 4 weeks significantly increases muscle carnosine content by 40–80% in training
population  [51].  Recent  studies  suggest  higher  efficacy  with  doses  up  to  12  g/day  [52].  Beta-alanine
ingestion  may  improve  anaerobic  threshold  meaning that  endurance  activities  can  be  performed  for
longer time at higher intensities [53]. Furthermore, beta-alanine ingestion may improve neuromuscular
fatigue, increase lean body mass and training volume [5]. In one of the studies, 4-weeks beta-alanine
supplementation  significantly  enhanced  performance  in  the  Special  Judo  Fitness  Test-followed
simulated combats [54].
Probably the most effective dietary supplement to increase high-intensity exercise performance in
combat  sports  is  creatine.  Injecting  creatine supplements  can  increase  intramuscular  phosphocreatine
(PCr), which is an energy buffer protecting the ATP concentration [55]. Muscle PCr depletion during
intensive  training  is  an  important  factor  causing  fatigue.  Increasing  intramuscular  PCr  emerges  can
delay  PCr  depletion  and  improve  anaerobic  performance  [3].  It  has  been  proved  that  creatine
supplementation  increases  strength,  power,  lean  body  mass  and  efficacy  in  high-intensity,  short-
duration  exercises  [56].  In  Radvanovic  et  al.  study  [57],  judo  athletes were  given  22  g  of  creatine
monohydrate  per  day  (in  4  doses  of  5.5  g)  during  the  first  week  of  research  in  comparison  to  the
placebo group. In the second week, subjects in the creatine group were given 1 dose of 5.5 g of creatine
daily.  Athletes  in  the placebo  group  followed  the  same  protocol,  but  were  given  a  dextrose  solution.
Before and after 2 weeks of supplementation, 30 second-Wingate cycle ergometer test was conducted
on  judo  athletes.  In  creatine  group  the  improvements  in  peak  (12%  improvement)  and mean  power
(10,8%  improvement)  were  2–3  times  higher  in  comparison  to  placebo  group  (4.4% and  5%
respectively)  [57].  The  most  common  dosing  protocol  is  creatine  loading.  During  the  first,  loading
phase subjects ingest high doses of creatine (approximately 20 g of creatine or 0.3 g/kg per day) in 4
doses  for  5  days.  In  the  second,  maintenance  phase  athletes  are  given  smaller  amounts  of  creatine,
generally 2–5 g daily (0.03 g/kg per day) for several weeks to months [42]. The average wash-out time
of creatine in humans is 4 weeks. It has to be noticed that muscle PCr increase depends on the initial
concentration of muscle PCr. High muscle PCr concentration can be reached by eating high amounts of
creatine rich food such as meat and fish. The athletes with high initial concentration of PCr could not
respond   positively   to   creatine   supplementation   [58].   The   most   problematic   aspect   of   creatine
supplementation for combat sports athletes is a muscle water retention which leads to increasing body
mass.  Athletes  who have to gain  weight limits for a competition may cease creatine supplementation
for approximately 4 weeks before weigh-in due to the average wash-out time.
Using supplements such as antioxidants may be beneficial due to alleviating oxidative stress and
inflammation induced by training. Exercise induces enhanced production of reactive species leading to
modifications  of  lipids,  proteins  and  nucleic  acid,  decreased  muscular  functionality,  histological
changes and muscular soreness [59]. During prolonged and high-intensity exercises, the potential risk
of free radical formation is more pronounced [60]. The study by Chun- Chung Chou [61] has shown,

## 491
AIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485–498.
that  4-days’ supplementation of 2000 mg vitamin C and 1400 IU vitamin E effectively attenuated
inflammatory  response and  exercise-induced  tissue  damage  in  elite  taekwondo  athletes.  [61].  In
another study by Samaras et all [60], authors indicated that a 2 months’ supplementation of a special
protein  bar  and  tomato  juice  significantly  improved  the  oxidative  status  in ultra-marathon  runners.
Nevertheless,  some  studies  have  shown  that  antioxidants  supplementation  may  potentially  blunt
beneficial  physiological  adaptations  induced  by  training  such  as  muscle  oxidative  capacity  and
mitochondrial biogenesis [62,63].
- Adverse effects of supplements
Using  supplements  can  be  connected  with  adverse  effects  that  can  affect  the  health  and  sports
career of the athlete [64]. Supplements can be contaminated with unlisted or banned substances such
as  anabolic  steroids  [65].  The  available data  suggests  that  almost  10–15%  of  supplements  may
contain  prohibited  substances  [66].  Despite  the  unintentional  injection  of  the  prohibited  substance,
the  athlete  may  be  banned  for  using  illegal  substances  and  loose  medals  and  records  set  [64].
Substances such as steroids are able to improve performance, increase the size of muscle fibers and
muscle  strength  [67].  Nevertheless,  a  variety  of  side  effects  can  occur  when  steroids  are  misused.
The  risk  of  using  steroids  include  health  outcomes  such  as  cardiomyopathy,  acne,  altered  serum
lipids,  hepatotoxity  and  swollen  breast  tissues  in  men  [64,67].  Supplements  may  also  be  used  by
innappriopriate  patterns  that  can  lead  to  hypervitaminosis  or  problematic  interactions  between
ingredients.  [64].  The  study  by Tsarouhas  et  al.  has  shown  that  almost  86%  of  recreational  athletes
did not check the labelling of the chosen product before using it [65].
A  special  group  of  food  supplements  are  available  as  preparation  for  weight  loss.  The  supposed
mechanism  of  weight loss supplements  includes  an  impact  on  appetite  regulation,  carbohydrate
absorption, fat metabolism and energy expenditure regulation. According to current scientific knowledge,
none of the available, legal dietary supplements are supported by high-quality evidence [68]. The most
popular,  evidence- based  preparation  for  weight  loss  is  ephedrine  which  has  been  prohibited  by  Food
And  Drug  Administration  in  2004  [69].  The  study  by  Boozer  et.  all  has  shown  that  a  6-month
supplementation  with  90  mg of  ephedrine alkaloids combined  with  192 mg  of  caffeine  daily  promoted
body weight and fat reduction in comparision to the placebo group [70]. Despite the possitive effect on
weight  reduction,  using  ephedrine  is  associated  with  high  risk  of  cardiovascular,  gastrointestinal and
psyhiatric  symptoms  [71].  Another  potential  effect  of  using  supplements  for  reducing  weight  is
hepatoxity.  The  supplements  including  garcinia  cambogia,  Herpalife  products,  green  tea  extract,  ma
huang, 1,3-Dimethylamylamine may  induce liver  injury [72–74].  In the study  by  Sticker et  al.,  authors
indicated that consumption of Herbalife products may be connected with liver injury. The possible reason
of  hepatoxic  potential  of  the  preparation  was  contamination  of  Bacillus  subtilis  [75].  Another  study  by
Tse- Ling  Fong  et  al.  as  shown  that  Hydroxycut  supplementation  may  a  cause  the  liver  injury,
nevetheless  ingredients  in  the  preparation  responsible  for  causing  the  injury  remain  uncertain  and  the
further research is required [76].
- Reducing weight
In most combat sports, athletes are classified in weight divisions according to their body mass.
Most athletes tend to reduce body weight in order to qualify for a lighter weight division so that they

could  fight  with  lighter,  smaller  and  weaker  opponents  [77].  Weight  loss  may  be  achieved  through
chronic strategies or rapid weight loss. Rapid weight loss includes the protocol when the body mass
is achieved in a few days prior to weigh-in. Both strategies could impact on sports performance and
provide  negative  health  outcomes.  Chronic  weight  loss  is  mostly  associated  with  the  energy
deficiency  and  could  negatively  affect  on  immune  function,  metabolic  rate,  bone  health,  hormone
process  and  lean  body  mass  [78,79].  Studies  have  shown  that  weight  cutting  may  influence
testosterone  level,  cortisol,  growth  hormone,  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  and  insulin.  The
influence on hormone process can result in decreasing bone mineral density, adolescent development
and  interfere  blood  glucose  regulation [1].  The  preferable  energy  deficiency  during  chronic  weight
loss should consitute up to 20% of energy reqiurements [9]. Kordi et al. [80] have shown that gradual
weight reduction is more than twice less common than rapid weight loss in the wrestlers community.
Nevertheless, gradual weight loss is more preferable [79]. If strictly necessary, rapid weight loss can
be the chosen way to reduce body mass but it shouldn’t exceed 5% of body mass. Furthermore, it
may be reflected only if the time from weight-in to competition is sufficient to refeed and rehydrate
(more than 3 hours) [3].
The most popular method of acute weight loss is an increase in exercise and restriction of fluid
and food intake. To reduce weight, many athletes use dehydration protocol in order to remove excess
water  from  the  body  [81].  One  of  the  methods  of  reducing  total  body  water  is  fluid  restriction  in
relation to normal daily losses. Reduction of water in the body can be derived from extracellular and
intracellular  stores  meaningly  free  and  bound  water  (in  glycogen stores  and  intestinal  space)  [79].
The  loss  of  the  body  water  is  induced  by  urination,  respiration  and  perspiration.  Urination,  as  the
primary  method  of  regulating  water  balance  is  controlled  by  the  renal system.  The  main  hormones
affecting  fluid  regulation  are  aldosterone  and  antidiuretic  hormone-vasopressin  [82]. One  of  the
methods used by combat sports athletes to increase urine production is water loading. This technique
involves the consumption of large fluid volume for several days prior to restriction. Reale at al. [81]
have  demonstrated that the  decrease of  body mass in the  water loading  group  was higher (3.2%) in
comparison to the control group (2.4%). The fluid intake in the water loading group was 100 ml/kg
for  3  days  in  comparison  to  40  ml/kg  in the control  group.  On  the  4
th
day  both  groups  were
consuming 15 ml/kg of fluids and were following the same rehydration protocols on 5
th
and 6
th
days.
Measurements of urea and serum electrolytes didn’t exceed reference levels in both groups. There
were no differences in physical performance between groups [81]. According to this protocol, water
loading seems to be safe method of rapid weight loss in combat sports. In contrast to water loading,
there are many popular methods of dehydration amongst combat sports athletes affecting negatively
on health and sports performance. Many sportsmen in order to lose body mass use pharmacological
diuretics,  saunas,  hot  water  or  train  in  plastic  suits  which  lead  to  an  increase  in  serum  osmolality,
body heat storage and heart rate [79]. In the study by Amatori et al. 83] authors indicated that more
severe weight loss strategies including training in heat environment, hydric restriction, using plastic
wear and saunas were practiced by professional fighters and high-level athletes.
The effects of dehydration can be enhanced by using a low sodium diet. It has been proved that a
high  intake  of  sodium  leads  to  an  increase  of  fluid  retention.  Reducing  the  intake  of  sodium  several
days prior to weigh-in  may intensify weight loss [79]. Another effective method of losing weight in
combat  sports  is  glycogen  depletion [81]. Glycogen  is  a  branched  polymer  of  glucose  stored  in  the
liver  and  skeletal  muscles  bound  to  water  in  proportion  of  1:3  g  (in  some  cases  this  ratio  could  be
higher) [84]. Glycogen storage can contribute 1–2% of skeletal muscle and up to 8% of liver weight.

## 493
AIMS Public Health                                                                                                              Volume 8, Issue 3, 485–498.
One  of  the  methods  leading  to  lower  glycogen  stores  is  a  low  carbohydrate  diet  connected  with  the
normal  training  program.  This  protocol  guides  to  glycogen  depletion  while  preventing  muscle
glycogen  restoration.  Another  method  of  degrading  glycogen  reserves  is  performing  additional
exercise in order to deplete glycogen stores more rapidly [8]. It has been proved that intake less than
50 g of carbohydrates daily combined with a small reduction in energy in the fight week may facilitate
1–2%  of  body  mass  loss  [79].  Furthermore,  it  has  to  be  noticed  that  decreased  levels  of  muscle
glycogen  may  affect  negatively  on  isometric  strength,  power,  endurance  and  time  to  fatigue [85].
Nevertheless, the studies by Lambert et al. [86] have shown that low carbohydrate diet lasting 2 weeks
didn’t impair the Wingate performance test. Similarly, Symons and Jacobs [87] reported that 2 days of
a low carbohydrate diet didn’t result in any changes  in  strength  and  endurance  in  comparison  to the
normal  carbohydrate  intake. It  seems  to  be  crucial  to  replenish  depleted  glycogen  stores  as  soon  as
possible  when  the  time  to  weigh-in  is  sufficient  [79]. Another  dietary  strategy  to  reduce  body  mass
before competition is reduction of gut contents. In order to manipulate the intestinal contents without
decreasing sports performance athletes may reduce total food volume and fiber intake. Consumption
of high-energy dense food with a low amount of fiber can increase body mass losses. It’s proved that
in comparison to high fiber diets, 2 days of low fiber intake helps to cleanse the bowel. Less than 10 g
intake  of  fiber  daily  is  known  to  be  as  effective  as  a  way  to  reduce  body  weight  without  affecting
performance [79].
## 9. Conclusions
The  appropriate  use  of  nutrition  can  enhance  sports  performance,  post-workout  regeneration  and
improve  body  composition  in  combat  sports  athletes. The  type,  as  well  as  the  time  of  macronutrient
intake, may enhance muscle protein synthesis, recovery and tissue repair. The primary source of energy
for combat sports athletes should be carbohydrates in order to ensure the proper level of muscle glycogen,
which is linked with higher ability to continue moderate and high-intensity trainings.
The positive effect  of  a  balanced  diet can  be  enhanced by sports  supplements.  There  are some
supplements which have a proven influence on strength, endurance and body composition in combat
sports such as sodium bicarbonate, caffeine, creatine, beta-alanine or protein supplements.
In  most  combat  sports  athletes  tend  to  reduce  body  mass  in  order  to  obtain  classification  in  a
lighter weight division. The most preferable way to reduce weight is gradual strategy of fat reduction
including low energy deficiency. If necessary, another method of reduction that may be used is rapid
weight loss. It has to be noticed that acute weight loss shouldn’t exceed 5% of body mass. Otherwise,
it could lead to serious health problems, for instance cardiovascular and endocrine system problems
or even death. Both strategies of weight loss could decrease sports performance so it’s necessary to
use safe, evidence-based protocols in order to minimize negative health outcomes. In order to lower
the  health  problems  and  maximise  sport potential,  each  athlete  should  be  placed  under  a  medical
team including doctors and nutritionists. Furthermore, it’s crucial to educate athletes about proper
nutrition and weight loss in combat sports.
