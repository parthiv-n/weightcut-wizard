            Start with the <span className="font-semibold">Today's call</span> card up top.
            It tells you whether to push, do a steady session, take it easy, or rest. That's the
            short answer for what to do.

            Glance at the three <span className="font-semibold">rings</span> for the why:
            Readiness (how prepared you are), Strain (today's load so far), and Overtraining risk
